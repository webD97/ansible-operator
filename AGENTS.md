# ansible-operator — agent notes

Opinionated Kubernetes operator that runs Ansible playbooks against cluster
nodes (via ephemeral **managed-ssh proxy pods**) or arbitrary external hosts
(via `StaticInventory` + a BYO SSH key). Inspired by Rancher's
system-upgrade-controller. Rust, built on `kube-rs` 3.x. Single binary, **three**
controllers running concurrently in `main.rs` via `tokio::join!`
(`playbookplancontroller`, `clusterinventorycontroller`, `nodeaccesspolicycontroller`).

> This operator is a **cluster-privileged, node-root primitive**. Before touching
> anything under `playbookplancontroller/` (especially `managed_ssh.rs`,
> `node_access.rs`, `ca.rs`) read `THREAT_MODEL.md` — it is the source of truth for

## Security invariants — do NOT regress without an explicit instruction

These are the numbered invariants in `THREAT_MODEL.md` §7, enforced by unit tests. They are the
whole point of the design. If a change would weaken one, stop and surface it; do not
"simplify" or "clean up" past them unless the user explicitly asks.

- **INV-1 — Fail-closed selectors.** `selector_matches_fail_closed` (`nodeselector.rs`)
  treats an *empty* selector as matching **nothing**; no matching `NodeAccessPolicy`
  ⇒ zero allowed nodes. (Opposite default from `selector_matches`/`node_matches`.)
- **INV-2 — Enforcement is intersection-only.** `node_access::enforce` may only *remove*
  hosts from managed-ssh groups, never add/substitute; `Ssh`/StaticInventory groups pass
  through untouched.
- **INV-3 — Enforcement runs before proxy infra.** NAP clamping happens at inventory
  resolve time (reconcile "step 0b"), on **every** reconcile, before any proxy pod/Secret/
  NetworkPolicy is created.
- **INV-3b — Every run re-authorizes before proxy creation.** Fresh and resumed absent-Job
  runs share `ensure_infra_and_launch`, which derives the node set from the groups it is about
  to render and re-authorizes *that* set live before `ensure_proxy_infra`, never a set read back
  from the record.
- **INV-4 — Cross-run isolation is at the cert layer.** Each proxy pod's
  `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile` lists **only its own run ID** (`build_secret`) —
  never `root`, never a wildcard. The client cert carries that run ID as a principal. The
  per-run `NetworkPolicy` is defense-in-depth on top, not the primary control.
- **INV-5 — Node set is authoritative & live.** The allow-set is a **live** Node read in
  `enforce`, never a cached one.
- **INV-6 — CA private key never leaves the operator process.** Generated in memory at
  startup (`ca.rs`, `CertificateAuthority::generate` in `main.rs`), never persisted to a
  Secret/etcd, never logged, never in a workspace Secret or the execution hash. A restart
  rotates it.
- **INV-7 — Proxy pods carry both `PLAYBOOKPLAN_HASH` and `PLAYBOOKPLAN_HOST`** so
  cleanup's label-scoped `delete_collection` cannot sweep the ansible Job pod (which lacks
  `_HOST`).

Two recent load-bearing fixes that look like "cleanups" but MUST NOT be reverted:
- **`StrictModes no` in `render_sshd_config`** — required so sshd will read the
  `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile` off the Kubernetes Secret tmpfs mount; without it every
  managed-ssh login fails with `Permission denied (publickey)`. (See its doc comment.)
- **The client-cert Secret is created in the *plan* namespace** (owner-referenced to the
  PlaybookPlan, deleted by name at run completion), because a pod can only mount Secrets
  from its own namespace. Moving it back to the operator namespace breaks any plan whose
  namespace ≠ the operator namespace.

## Layout

    static_inventory.rs              StaticInventory: literal names/IPs + embedded SSH config (BYO key); no controller/status
    node_access_policy.rs            NodeAccessPolicy: admin-authored namespace→node ceiling (cluster-scoped CRD; enforcement reads all policies)

    clusterinventorycontroller/      resolves Node → hosts, watches Nodes, writes ClusterInventoryStatus
    nodeaccesspolicycontroller/      writes NodeAccessPolicyStatus (matched namespaces / allowed nodes) for observability; watches ns + nodes
    selector_trigger.rs              label_changes: the set-valued controllers' watch trigger — ticks only on a label change, an appearance or a disappearance; must stay in lockstep with what nodeselector.rs reads
    ansible_inventory.rs             ResolvedInventoryGroup (ManagedSsh | Ssh) + ResolvedHosts; AnsibleInventory trait (get_hosts); distinct_hosts/_count (every host-population count, in both controllers)

    reconcile_error.rs               shared ReconcileError (thiserror)
  controllers/playbookplancontroller/
    reconciler.rs                    the reconcile pipeline (below); patch_status via JSON merge patch
    mappers.rs                       maps Secret, NodeAccessPolicy, ClusterInventory and StaticInventory changes to affected plans; the Secret watch asks two rules (named in `variables`/`files`, or holding a StaticInventory's SSH key)
    node_access.rs                   NodeAccessPolicy enforcement: fail-closed intersection clamp (INV-2/3/5)
    node_readiness.rs                Node Ready-condition predicates + the OneShot "hold instead of starting" gate; readiness only, never authorization
    node_recreation.rs               drops a host's recorded application when its Node was registered after `appliedAt` — a rebuilt machine inherits the name, never the claim. Level-triggered on purpose: a deletion the operator was down for leaves no event to react to
    departed_hosts.rs                prunes `hostsStatus` rows for hosts that left the inventory **and** no longer exist as Nodes (housekeeping; `hostsStatus` otherwise only ever grows). Requiring both is what stops a narrowed NodeAccessPolicy from dropping live machines' records and re-running them when it widens again. Deletion needs an explicit `null` per key — a merge patch cannot delete by omission
    managed_ssh.rs                   proxy pods (hostPID + nsenter = NODE ROOT), per-run sshd config/certs/principals, NetworkPolicy, cleanup (INV-4/7)
    locking.rs                       per-host Leases (operator ns) for run mutual-exclusion
    play_history.rs                  writes/prunes the immutable Play run records; its module doc is the authoritative PlayPhase state machine
    job_builder.rs                   builds the one Job per run (volumes, client-cert mount, callback env, node anti-affinity)
    workspace.rs                     renders the per-plan workspace Secret (playbook.yml/inventory.yml/recap plugin/vars), owner-ref'd to the plan, named `workspace-{plan}-{uid shortid}` so it cannot land on a user's Secret
    execution_evaluator.rs           ExecutionHash over playbook + referenced Secrets (excludes the self-rendered workspace Secret)
    callback_output.rs               parses the recap the callback wrote to the pod termination message
    triggers.rs                      validated 5-field Schedule newtype + total evaluate_schedule / forecast_next_run, timezone-aware
    status.rs                        folds a terminal Play's per-host results into PlaybookPlanStatus conditions (the only place run outcomes reach the plan)
                                     `Phase::HostsUnreachable` splits a failed run in two: everything reachable was applied and only unreachable hosts are left. A failure everywhere the mechanics ask (`is_failure_verdict` — retries, schedule window, summary wording) and differs from `Failed` only in what it tells a human, so a plan parked on a dead machine does not read as a broken playbook. Decided by `phase_for_finished_run`, which needs the per-host results and so runs where the terminal `PlayStatus` is still in hand; `FinishedRun` carries the resulting verdict rather than the run's own `PlayPhase`.
    paths.rs                         shared mount-path conventions between workspace/inventory_renderer/job_builder
  ansible/
    playbook_renderer.rs             round-trips spec.template.playbook YAML (validation)
    inventory_renderer.rs            ResolvedInventoryGroup → Ansible YAML inventory (managed-ssh: proxy IP + HostKeyAlias; ssh: BYO key)
    render_error.rs                  shared YAML rendering error type
    ansible_operator_preflight.py    managed-ssh preflight gate; waits for every reachable proxy SSH banner
    ansible_operator_recap.py        Ansible callback plugin: writes per-host recap to /dev/termination-log
  labels.rs                          PLAYBOOKPLAN_NAME / _HASH / _HOST / RUN_ID label keys, plus PLAY_UID_ANNOTATION (an annotation, never selectable)
```

The managed-SSH preflight script is covered by `tests/python/test_preflight.py` and `just test-python`.

## Core reconcile flow (playbookplancontroller/reconciler.rs)

Level-triggered / idempotent "ensure" style — every step re-derives what's needed from
observed cluster state; there is no persisted "current step". One `PlaybookPlan` fans out
into **one Kubernetes Job per run** (targeting that run's hosts), plus **one managed-ssh
proxy pod per targeted ClusterInventory host** in the operator namespace.

1. **Enrollment guard (R1).** If the plan's namespace isn't in the enrolled set
   (`config.rs`: operator ns ∪ `watch_namespaces`), refuse with `Phase::UnauthorizedNamespace`
   and `await_change` — before any Secret/Job call (the operator holds no Secret/Job RBAC
   outside the enrolled set).
   A **name guard** follows in the same shape (`plan_name_within_label_limit`): a plan name over
   `MAX_PLAN_NAME_LEN` (63, the *label value* cap — the name is written as a label onto the `Play`,
   the Job, its pod template and the run's NetworkPolicy) is refused with `Phase::Failed` and
   `await_change`. The CRD rejects it at admission too; the reconciler re-checks it for clusters
   that don't evaluate validation rules.
2. **Step 0a — `recover_active_run`.** Runs *first*, before inventory is even resolved: lists
   this plan's `Play`s, keeps the ones it owns (`spec.playbookPlan` + `spec.playbookPlanUid`,
   not the label), deletes any statusless record (it never crossed the operator-owned status
   boundary, so nothing may be derived from it), and dispatches on `PlayPhase` —
   `Prepared`/`Starting`/`Launching` ⇒ **deferred** to after inventory resolution (deciding
   whether they may still be resumed needs the resolved, policy-clamped groups the fingerprint
   covers), `Running` ⇒ carry on, `Aborted` ⇒ `abandon_run`, terminal-but-unacknowledged ⇒
   apply its result to the plan.
   A recovery failure is reported on the plan (`summary`) *before* the tick aborts.
3. **Scheduling validation boundary.** `validate_scheduling_configuration` is evaluated before
   recovery, so no unvalidated tenant string reaches schedule evaluation, but its result is acted on
   only after recovery and active-Job advancement. Invalid mutable scheduling fields therefore block
   new runs without preventing an existing Job from finishing or its privileged resources from being
   recovered and released. The runtime guard covers objects that predate or bypass CRD validation.
4. **Steps 0 + 0b — resolve inventory, then clamp it (INV-2/3/5).**
   `resolve_authorized_inventory` runs `resolve_inventory` → `Vec<ResolvedInventoryGroup>`
   (`ClusterInventory` ⇒ `ManagedSsh`, `StaticInventory` ⇒ `Ssh`, preserving which resource each
   group came from) and then `node_access::enforce`, which clamps managed-ssh nodes to the
   fail-closed intersection of the plan namespace's allowed nodes. One step on purpose: nothing may
   observe the unclamped result. `warn!`s excluded nodes; sets `status.eligible_hosts`.
   A `ClusterInventory` whose `status.observedGeneration` is behind its `metadata.generation` is
   refused here (`InventoryNotSynced`, classified transient so it *holds* an unlaunched run rather
   than superseding it): its published `resolvedHosts` still answer for the spec before the edit, and
   one `helm upgrade` that changes an inventory and a plan together would otherwise launch against
   the host set the edit replaced.
5. **Execution hash.** `ExecutionHash` over the playbook text + contents of every referenced
   Secret (variables + files), order-insensitive; deliberately **excludes** the workspace
   Secret (its content — proxy IPs — legitimately changes each run). Hash change ⇒
   `last_run_number` reset to 0, `last_triggered_run` cleared (so an edit can start inside the
   window its predecessor used, and a revert is just another change), and `Phase::Pending`
   **only when there is no `active_run`** — an in-flight run keeps `Applying` and its own hash
   (which lives in its `Play`), and the new revision waits for it.
6. **Step 1 — schedule + outdated hosts.** `triggers::evaluate_schedule` in the plan's
   timezone within a 15s window; `hosts_to_trigger` = outdated hosts (`OneShot`) or all hosts
   (`Recurring`).
7. **`try_start_run` (steps 2–5)** when eligible and nothing is active: `select_job` numbers
   the run one past everything still claiming a name (Jobs *and* retained `Play`s — it
   never adopts a running Job, see below), `play_history::record_prepared` writes the
   immutable record, then acquire per-host **Leases** (`locking.rs`) and `commit_starting`.
   From there `ensure_infra_and_launch` does the rest: re-authorize the nodes (INV-3b),
   `reset_incomplete_run` (drops half-built infra the current CA can't authenticate against),
   ensure **managed-ssh proxy infra** is Ready (`managed_ssh::ensure_proxy_infra`: proxy pods
   + per-host Secrets + NetworkPolicy in the operator ns, client-cert Secret in the plan ns),
   render the **workspace Secret** with the live proxy pod IPs, `commit_launching`, create the
   **one Job** and `record_running`. A resumed `Prepared`/`Starting` run re-enters
   `try_start_run` with its recorded identity. A `Launching` run first checks whether the Job
   already exists; an absent Job re-enters `ensure_infra_and_launch`, while an existing one is
   adopted without depending on the newly desired inventory.
8. **`advance_active_run`** once the Job is terminal: parse the per-host recap
   from the pod's **termination message** (`callback_output.rs`, written by the callback
   plugin — not from logs, no `pods/log` access), `cleanup_proxy_infra`, release Leases,
   `record_finished` on the `Play`, fold it into the plan via
   `status::apply_terminal_play_status`, stage the finished record, and set the terminal `Phase`
   (or reschedule for `Recurring`). The complete status is persisted before the `Play` is
   acknowledged and eligible for pruning, so a failure anywhere before that write replays the
   result instead of stranding a provisional status.
   This is also where a run whose `Play` is gone is `finalize_lost_run`'d (infra released, hosts
   `Unknown`) — not in step 0a: recovery has no record left to dispatch on, so it is the *mirror*
   in `status.activeRun` that brings the run here to be released.
9. **`patch_status`** — JSON **merge patch** (not `replace_status`); many async steps pass
   between read and write, so a version-checked PUT would routinely 409. It is also where the
   suspension contract is held (`suspended_advertises_no_next_run`): a tick has several ways to write
   a status and only one way to reach the end of the pipeline, so "a suspended plan advertises no
   `nextRun`" belongs at the write, not at the end. Terminal `Play` acknowledgement and the
   version-checked *finalizer* write (`drop_run_cleanup_finalizer`) come **after** it. That write is
   conditioned on the plan `patch_status` *returned*, not on the tick's starting read — the status
   patch moves the `resourceVersion`, so the starting read's copy would fail the precondition against
   nothing but this tick's own write. A 409 therefore means somebody else wrote the plan, and is
   treated as "retry next tick" rather than discarding the status just written.

Requeue is dynamic: 3600s default, tightened to "time until next scheduled run" / 15s
(Job-polling) / 5s (waiting on proxy readiness) as appropriate.

### managed-ssh (the node-root path)

A `ClusterInventory` host is reached by scheduling an ephemeral **proxy pod onto that node**
(`hostPID: true`, host `/proc` bind-mount, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`+`CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, SELinux `spc_t`);
every SSH session is wrapped in `nsenter` into the host namespaces (`enter-host.sh`). So a
managed-ssh session is **root on the node** — that is the feature, and the reason
`NodeAccessPolicy` exists. Certs are minted per run from the in-memory CA; cross-run isolation
is the per-run `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile` run-ID principal (INV-4). See `managed_ssh.rs` doc
comments (they encode hard-won runtime facts: BusyBox `nsenter` short-option quirks, the sftp
`ForceCommand` trick, `StrictModes no`, why `hostPID` can't be joined per-session).

### Execution modes (`ExecutionMode`)

- `OneShot` (default): only outdated hosts run; once every host is current, `Succeeded`/`Failed`
  and it goes quiet until the hash changes.
- `Recurring`: *all* hosts run every schedule tick; keeps the finished run's `Succeeded`/`Failed`
  and forecasts the next slot into `next_run` via `forecast_next_run`.

Either way the phase of a finished run comes from that run's own `Play` verdict
(`phase_for_finished_run`), never from the plan's drift state: a failed `Recurring` run leaves every
host on the hash an earlier run applied, so drift would report it as a success.

### Retries (`spec.maxAttempts`)

Tries per *execution*, counting the first run: the current hash for `OneShot` (default 3), one
schedule tick for `Recurring` (default 1). Every try is a full run — own `Play`, own `runId`, own
Job, own run number — and `status.retryCount` counts them within the execution, restarting on a hash
change (`update_desired_hash`) and, for `Recurring`, at each tick (`next_attempt`).
`status.retryCountSlot` identifies the schedule tick that a recurring count belongs to, so the count
remains meaningful when `lastTriggeredRun` is stale or absent. Both are written from the run's
record, never re-derived.

Two gates, deliberately: `attempt_budget_available` at `may_start_new_run` is the whole answer for
`OneShot` (nothing else ever stops it — its failed hosts stay outdated), while `Recurring` is
answered by the schedule-window gate, which is the only one that can tell a retry of the current
tick from the first run of the next.

The operator appends a `__ansible_operator_completion_marker` play to every rendered playbook
(`ansible::playbook_renderer`), and the recap callback reports per host whether it produced a result
for that play's single task. This is the only way to tell "ran the whole playbook" from "was fine up
to the point the play stopped": under an `any_errors_fatal`/`serial`/`max_fail_percentage` abort a
surviving host reports `failed=0, unreachable=0`, identical to one that ran every task, and no
callback hook announces the abort. An abort ends the whole playbook run so nobody reaches the marker,
while a host that failed or went unreachable is dropped from later plays and so does not reach it
either — which makes the answer per host. `HostOutcome::Incomplete` is that case, and it is
deliberately not `Succeeded`, so `apply_terminal_play_status` does not stamp `lastAppliedHash` on a
host that received part of a playbook. The task name is duplicated in `playbook_renderer.rs` and
`ansible_operator_recap.py`; a test pins them together, because a drift there reads as "nothing
converged" on every plan at once.

A `OneShot` run gets its budget back when it made all the progress that was available to it, which
is a `Succeeded` verdict *or* a failure confined to Nodes the run recorded as not `Ready` at its
launch commit **and that still applied the playbook to at least one host**
(`classify_run_failure`, `PlayStatus::unreachable_hosts`). That record holds every host
the run excluded, each flagged with whether its Node was itself down — a host excluded because a
`Ready` Node's proxy pod never came up is a configuration problem and is not refunded. It has to be
captured at launch and persisted: the recap says nothing at all about a host the run excluded, and
the Node may have recovered by the time the result is drained.

That record and the run's `--limit` file are written from **one** variable in one tick, and must
stay that way. A resumed run whose Job was never created re-reads its proxy pods, so the launch
commit re-states the set rather than treating the replay as a pure no-op — the phase half stays
idempotent, the data half does not. Left un-restated, the file and the record would describe
different runs: a host excluded in one but not the other either loses its `unreachable` from the
recap, or runs the playbook and is reported unreachable anyway, never stamped, and re-run forever.
It is still "at launch", because a run whose Job exists is adopted rather than resumed, so the last
write is always the one immediately before the Job that ran.

An SSH key rotation is the one input that is *noticed* without being hashed. `StaticInventory`
key material is deliberately outside the execution hash — that hash decides which hosts are outdated,
so folding a key into it would re-apply the playbook to hosts that are already current. Instead
`status.observedSshKeyRevision` fingerprints it (`execution_evaluator::hash_secret_data`), and a
change restores a `OneShot` plan's attempt budget when its last run did not succeed
(`sync_ssh_key_revision`). The budget reset is the point: a plan whose hosts rejected the old key has
spent every try by then — a `StaticInventory` host has no proxy grace window in front of it — so
waking it alone would achieve nothing. `mappers::ssh_secret_to_playbookplans` supplies the wake-up,
and both sides share `status::may_need_another_run` so the mapper can never wake a plan the reset
would then decline. The first observation is recorded without acting, which is what keeps an upgrade
from handing every failed plan a free retry at once.

The "applied to at least one host" half is a bound, not a nicety: the gate reads the Node at tick
time while `node_not_ready` is read a grace window later, so a Node that alternates across that
window passes the gate *and* earns the refund, and the plan would run every grace window forever.
A refund is credit for progress, so a run with none spends its attempt and `maxAttempts` bounds the
flap. Hysteresis on the gate's release was considered and rejected — it damages the reboot workflow
the gate exists for, and only filters flaps faster than the delay it adds. That relief
and the `node_readiness` start gate are a matched pair — the relief is what stops a stranded Node
burning the budget, the gate is what stops the plan re-running against it every grace window. Neither
belongs without the other.

### Run records and recovery (`Play`)

Every run is written down **before** anything is created for it, as a `Play` in the plan's
namespace whose spec is immutable (a CEL `self == oldSelf` rule). **The authoritative descriptions
live in the code**: `play_history.rs`'s module doc for the `PlayPhase` protocol, `play.rs` for the
spec and why every field is typed, `reconciler.rs`'s `resume_launching_run` for the Job-existence
boundary. Keep those correct rather than restating them here. What belongs at this level is the
handful of decisions that are easy to undo by accident:

- **Do not reintroduce snapshots of the plan spec, resolved connection config or the Job blueprint**
  "so a run can finish what it started". They are pure functions of the live plan and the live
  resolved groups, which is exactly what `preparationFingerprint` covers; `create_job_blueprint` is
  deterministic, so a resumed rebuild is byte-identical. An unlaunched run whose inputs changed is
  deliberately *not* finished.
- **A run is mirrored onto the plan's status before it acquires anything.** `try_start_run` writes
  the record, then patches `activeRun`, and only then takes host Leases and creates proxy pods. The
  record alone is not enough to hold that ordering open: it is a *dependent* of the plan, so a
  `--cascade=foreground` delete has the garbage collector remove it while the run-cleanup finalizer
  still holds the plan, and `release_deleted_plan` would then find no handle on resources in the
  operator namespace that nothing else can collect. The mirror is a field of the plan and cannot be
  collected separately. Do not move lock acquisition or proxy creation above that patch.
- **Only `Prepared` is gated on the schedule window** and the rest of `has_work_to_start`.
  `Starting`/`Launching` wait on proxy pods, which routinely outlasts `startingDeadlineSeconds`;
  gating them would leave a scheduled plan unable to launch.
- **The schedule window is gated on slot-scoped budget state and records, not only on
  `lastTriggeredRun`.** That marker is a *derived* view of "a run for this slot got a Job", written
  onto a status read from the reflector cache and re-stated from it by every merge patch — so a tick
  running behind the write, or one whose write was lost to a conflict, cannot be trusted alone.
  `schedule_window_already_taken`/`window_taken_by_a_record` re-ask the question of the plan's own
  `Play`s (which book revision and slot before anything is created) before a new run is prepared.
  Since `maxAttempts` the question is no longer "did a run take this slot" but "is there anything
  left for a run to do in it": a record still `Running` or one that `Succeeded` closes the window,
  while failures close it only once they have spent the budget. A `OneShot` failure the budget
  refunded (`returns_its_attempt`) spent nothing and is not counted — the refund and this count must
  answer from the same predicate, or the refund is taken back here. `retryCountSlot` binds
  `retryCount` to its recurring execution, so status can close an exhausted window after its records
  have been pruned and `next_attempt` does not restart at one when `lastTriggeredRun` is stale.
- **`spec.suspend` is decided before the inventory is read** (`resolve_unlaunched_before_inputs`),
  for every phase — dropping an unlaunched run needs no inventory, and deferring it would leave a
  suspended plan sitting on its host Leases behind a read that may never succeed. That is why
  `has_work_to_start` excludes it and `decide_unlaunched_action` may assume it is not set; folding it
  back in there looks like a simplification and is a second, later decision.
- **The complete result reaches the plan first and the `Play` second.** The terminal phase, summary,
  retry budget and schedule state are patched before the `Play` is acknowledged, so a crash or
  input-read failure before that boundary replays idempotently. `plays_to_prune` therefore never
  prunes an unacknowledged terminal record, nor an `Aborted` one.
- **`recover_active_run` enforces one-run-at-a-time rather than assuming it.** More than one *in
  flight* record fails the tick loudly (`sole_active_record`) instead of orphaning the loser's
  node-root proxy pods — after `renew_contested_locks` has kept every candidate's hosts protected. It
  deliberately does *not* second-guess a `Running` record's Job: only `advance_active_run` can tell an
  unfinished foreign Job (wait) from a finished one (finalize with no recap), and deciding it in
  recovery wedged the plan forever.
- **`PlaybookPlanStatus.activeRun` is a thin mirror** of what *finishing* a run needs, so a run whose
  `Play` was deleted can still be released (`finalize_lost_run`) instead of wedging in `Applying`. It
  is read from the reflector cache, which lags this controller's own writes, so `finalize_lost_run`
  re-reads the plan from the apiserver first and adopts a disagreeing live status wholesale
  (`ActiveRunProgress::AlreadyFinalized`).
- **Do not make the run ID a function of (plan, hash, runNumber)** to save recording it. An aborted
  run frees its number again, so a derived ID would hand the retry that run's
  still-terminating proxy pods — see `reconciler::run_id`.
- **A contended lock is not automatically a lost one.** `locking::renew_locks` separates an observed
  takeover (`Lost`) from a write race (`Unconfirmed`); only the first may abandon a run
  (`resolve_contended_locks`). Collapsing them would let a transient 409 tear down node-root infra.

### Job naming and idempotency

Job name is `apply-{plan}-{shortid}-{runNumber}` (`job_builder::job_name`, which also names the
`Play`), where `shortid` is **ten symbols of a hash over the plan's UID *and* the execution hash**
(`run_short_id`) and `{plan}` is **truncated** to whatever `utils::MAX_DNS_LABEL_LEN` leaves after
the rest — 44 characters at a single-digit run, one fewer per further digit. A Job name has to be
a DNS *label* (it becomes the `job-name` label value on its pods) while a plan may carry a full
subdomain, and the record is written under this name *before* the Job, so an unbounded name would be
accepted for the `Play` and then refused for the Job. Keying the short id on the plan UID is what
makes the lossy readable half safe. Both numbers are pinned by
`the_plan_name_half_is_truncated_from_45_characters` — they are quoted to the user in
`scheduling-and-modes.md`, so change them there too or not at all.

The run number is in the name because the hash alone is unchanged between retries of an identical
spec. `select_job` numbers a new run one past everything still claiming a name — *all* of this
plan's Jobs *and* all of its retained `Play`s (including statusless ones, which occupy their name
until recovery deletes them), across every revision and not just the one being named. That last part
is load-bearing: `shortid` truncates a 64-bit hash to ten symbols, so two revisions *of one plan*
(same UID) can still produce the same name, and per-hash numbering would let one claim a name a
retained record of the other still holds — `record_prepared` then rejects it as another run's on
every tick until pruning removes it.
The number, not the hash, is what makes the name unique; a new revision therefore does not restart at
1. It **never adopts an already-running Job**: every Job the operator creates has
a `Play` recorded before it, so an active Job that `recover_active_run` didn't account for isn't this
run's, and adopting it would pair it with a freshly minted `run_id` its own record contradicts.
Resuming a genuinely in-flight run is recovery's job; same-run idempotency within a tick is
`spawn_ansible_job`'s (`get_opt` + 409-tolerant create, both validated by `validate_selected_job`).

`validate_selected_job` matches on **identity, not content**: the run's `Play` UID on both the Job
and its pod template, the plan owner reference, the hash, the run ID and the run number. A Job's
pod template is immutable once created, so identity already implies the blueprint — while a
field-by-field comparison would have to model every server-side default and mutating webhook, and each
field it mispredicted would disown a healthy run — the operator would sit out the whole run holding
its host Leases, then write it off as `Unknown`.
Per-node **Leases** give run mutual exclusion.

### Secret / Node change triggers

`.watches(secrets_api, …, mappers::secret_to_playbookplans(…))` re-triggers a plan when a
referenced Secret changes — but Secret/Job watches are set up **per enrolled namespace**, not
cluster-wide (the operator's `secrets`/`jobs` RBAC is scoped there; a cluster-wide `Api::all`
watch would 403). The `ClusterInventory`/`StaticInventory` watches
(`mappers::cluster_inventory_to_playbookplans` / `..._static_...`) are cluster-wide like the plan
watch itself, since CRD reads are (R1). They exist because `resolve_inventory` reads both kinds
**live on every tick**, so their contents were always fresh whenever a reconcile happened — nothing
made one happen, and an inventory that gained a host reached its plans only on their next requeue.
`clusterinventorycontroller` and `nodeaccesspolicycontroller` are the *set-valued* controllers: their
whole status is a function of every Node (and, for policies, every Namespace), so there is no
per-object targeting to do and both recompute everything on every trigger. What is narrow is the
**trigger**, `selector_trigger::label_changes` + `Controller::reconcile_all_on`, which ticks only
when a label moves or an object appears or disappears. A mapper cannot do this job: `watches`
flattens `watcher::Event` through `touched_objects()` before the mapper runs, and a deleted Node
still carries the labels it matched with, so a content-only predicate would miss every deletion and
strand a departed machine in `resolvedHosts` until the hourly requeue. The filter hashes **labels**
because labels are exactly what `nodeselector` reads — a selector term over taints, annotations or
spec fields would be invisible to it, so the two must move together.

The plan controller also watches **Nodes**, through one reflector serving two jobs: the mapper
(`mappers::node_to_playbookplans`) and the readiness lookups the reconcile does
(`node_readiness::unready_nodes`). The mapper is deliberately narrow — a Node that is `Ready` *and*
in the plan's `eligibleHosts` *and* not yet on the plan's `currentHash` — because every kubelet
reposts its Node status periodically, so an "all plans" mapping would reconcile every plan every few
minutes forever, scaling with node count. A converged cluster matches no plans and the heartbeats
fall on the floor. It asks the *plan* as well as the host, because a wake the plan cannot act on
costs exactly as much as one it can: a suspended plan, a `OneShot` plan out of attempts, and every
`Recurring` plan are all refused. `Recurring` is refused outright because only the clock starts its
runs — the readiness gate it would be released by is `OneShot`-only — and it is the one mode with no
budget to bound the wakes, so one stuck host would otherwise wake it per heartbeat forever.

`reconciler::new` is `async` for one reason: it waits for that reflector's initial LIST before
handing back a controller. An unsynced Node cache reports every node `Ready`, which is precisely the
answer that starts the runs the readiness gate exists to hold back — so after a restart every held
plan would launch one, take its hosts' Leases for the full proxy grace window and report everything
unreachable. `main` drives this controller as a future of its own so that wait does not delay the
other two.

The wait is bounded (`NODE_CACHE_SYNC_TIMEOUT`, 2 min) and **fatal**: `await_node_cache` panics
rather than carrying on, because `Store::wait_until_ready` resolves only on a populated cache or a
dropped writer, and a `watcher` retries a failing watch forever — so an unbounded wait would leave
the controller pending for the life of the process while the other two kept the operator looking
healthy. `join!` in `main` is what turns that panic into a process exit; spawning the controllers
instead would park it in a `JoinHandle` nobody reads and restore exactly the silent half-alive state.

**It bounds the first sync only.** A watch that breaks after the cache is populated leaves the
`Store` serving its last contents for the life of the process, so the gate keeps answering from a
snapshot and degrades from there — a Node that goes down afterwards still reads `Ready`. That is
deliberately not treated the same way: with no answer at all, refusing to start is strictly better
than guessing, while with a stale one every response trades one failure for another (crashing turns
an apiserver blip into a restart loop; holding every run stops a fleet on a watch error). Which
trade is right is an open decision, so the reflector task (`NodeWatchFailures`) only escalates its
log after `NODE_WATCH_FAILURES_BEFORE_ESCALATING`, repeats that line every
`NODE_WATCH_ESCALATION_INTERVAL` and says when the watch recovers — making the state loud, which is
the half that was missing. Only `Apply`, `Delete` and `InitDone` count as the cache updating: a
watcher whose re-LIST keeps failing yields `Init` before every attempt, so counting that as success
would never let a failing re-list escalate.

That reflector is for **readiness only**. `node_access::enforce` keeps its own *live* Node read:
the allow-set is a security gate and INV-5 says it is never served from a cache.

## Enrolled namespaces (R1)

The operator only reads/writes Secrets and creates Jobs in **enrolled** namespaces = its own
namespace ∪ the chart's `watchNamespaces`, granted via a per-namespace `Role`/`RoleBinding`
(the `ClusterRole` has no `secrets`/`jobs`/`pods`). Config is read once at startup from the
mounted ConfigMap; a change rolls the pod via `checksum/config` (no hot-reload). A plan in a
non-enrolled namespace is fail-closed to `UnauthorizedNamespace`. The operator can **read and
delete** Secrets in every enrolled namespace, so operators should enroll only namespaces
dedicated to Ansible ops (see `THREAT_MODEL.md` §6 / T-INFO-1).

## Known rough edges / things to know before touching related code

- **Raw cron strings cross one validation boundary.** `cron::Schedule::from_str` must only be called
  by `triggers::Schedule::parse`, which enforces the public five-field contract before adapting it to
  the cron crate's seconds field. `evaluate_schedule` and `forecast_next_run` must remain total: a
  syntactically valid expression can have no future occurrence, and that must return `None` for the
  reconciler to report, never panic and put the whole operator into CrashLoopBackOff on tenant input.
- **Status writes on the reconciled primary object are JSON merge patches** in all three
  controllers (`patch_status` → `Patch::Merge({"status": …})`), not `Api::replace_status` (a
  version-checked PUT that would routinely 409 across a reconcile's many async steps). Only the
  `.status` subresource is sent.
- **`Play` records go the opposite way, deliberately.** Every step of the record protocol
  (`play_history::record_prepared` … `acknowledge_finished`) reads the object fresh and writes it
  back through `replace_status`, so each write carries a `resourceVersion` precondition. The 409 the
  plan's status write must avoid is the whole point here: a record is a per-run receipt for a
  privileged run, and losing a write race on one must be noticed, not merged over. `decide_transition`
  makes replaying a step that already landed a no-op, and `transition_phase` re-reads and re-decides
  once before surfacing a conflict. Don't "fix" this to a merge patch for consistency with the bullet
  above — the two are answering different questions.
- `examples/v1beta1/*.yaml` is the canonical CRD shape; `examples/ssh.yaml` (top-level) is the
  only remaining older example — prefer `v1beta1/` when writing docs/examples.
- Deliberate `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` style: preconditions the apiserver genuinely guarantees are
  unwrapped; only things this operator must guarantee (namespace/name/generation/uid on the
  primary object) go through `ReconcileError::PreconditionFailed`. Match this — don't blanket-add
  error plumbing to apiserver-guaranteed invariants, and don't unwrap things the operator owns.
- `FilesSource::Other` round-trips arbitrary JSON/YAML through a real
  `k8s_openapi::…::Volume` via `serde_json` (any volume type without hand-modeling); errors
  surface per-item as `Result`, not a panic.
- `ansible/playbook_renderer.rs` re-parses+re-serializes the playbook mostly as validation.
- The `NodeAccessPolicy` CRD is *cluster-scoped* — creating one requires cluster RBAC, which is
  what makes it an admin (not tenant) control. Enforcement reads **every** policy in the cluster;
  a namespace's allow-set is the union across all policies whose `namespaceSelector` matches it.
- **`watcher` streams back off through `controllers::watch_backoff::WatchBackoff`, not
  `.default_backoff()`.** kube's `StreamBackoff` resets its delay on every `Ok` item, and a watcher
  whose re-LIST fails yields `Ok(Event::Init)` before every retry, so `.default_backoff()` retries a
  refused LIST about once a second for as long as it is refused. `WatchBackoff` drops that reset and
  keeps only the one after two quiet minutes; use it for any new `watcher` stream.

## User & operator documentation (`docs/` mdBook) — keep in sync with the code

End-user and cluster-operator docs are an **mdBook** under `docs/` (`docs/book.toml`, chapters in
`docs/src/*.md`, TOC in `docs/src/SUMMARY.md`; `just docs` builds it to the git-ignored `docs/book/`).
This is the narrative guide; rustdoc (`just apidoc`) is the separate API reference for the code. Two
chapters: `docs/src/running-playbooks/` (users authoring PlaybookPlans/inventories) and
`docs/src/cluster-operators/` (admins installing/securing the operator). The guide is **part of the
change surface** — a behaviour/API/security change is not done until the matching page is updated. Map:

- CRD field / default / enum change → the page for that resource under `running-playbooks/`:
  `playbook-plans.md` (PlaybookPlan), `cluster-nodes.md` (ClusterInventory), `external-hosts.md`
  (StaticInventory), `variables-and-files.md` (`template.variables`/`files`), `scheduling-and-modes.md`
  (`schedule`/`mode`/hash), `results-and-troubleshooting.md` (status/phases/outcomes); or
  `cluster-operators/node-access-policies.md` (NodeAccessPolicy).
- Chart / deploy / RBAC / PSA / SELinux / proxy-image / `watchNamespaces` change → `cluster-operators/deployment.md`.
- Threat-model / invariant change → `cluster-operators/security.md` (a **summary**; `THREAT_MODEL.md`
  stays the source of truth — the page says so, so update both and keep them consistent).
- Secret-key conventions the user must match (`variables.yaml`; StaticInventory `id_rsa`/`known_hosts`;
  file mount paths under `/run/ansible-operator/files/<name>`) live in `variables-and-files.md` /
  `external-hosts.md` — re-verify against `workspace.rs`/`job_builder.rs`/`inventory_renderer.rs`/`paths.rs`
  if you touch those.

Conventions: the guide is **prose** — refer to CRD types as inline code (`` `PlaybookPlan` ``) and
defer exhaustive field lists to the API reference (`ansible-operator crds` / `just apidoc`), don't
restate whole field tables. Cross-references between pages are **relative markdown links**
(`./playbook-plans.md`, `../cluster-operators/deployment.md#enrolled-namespaces`); heading anchors are
mdBook slugs (lowercase, punctuation stripped, spaces→`-`), so a link into `## The proxy image`
becomes `#the-proxy-image`. Verify with `just docs`; adding/removing a page also needs a `SUMMARY.md`
entry (a page missing from `SUMMARY.md` is not rendered). mdBook has no built-in broken-link check, so
eyeball new cross-page links (or run the `mdbook-linkcheck` backend if installed).

## Testing & workflow

- `cargo test` — unit tests colocated in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of each file
  (no `tests/` dir for Rust); follow this convention. Prefer extracting a small pure function (as
  `execution_evaluator`, `triggers`, `status`, `nodeselector`, `node_access::clamp_*`,
  `job_builder::extract_file_volumes` do) over testing through the full `reconcile()`.
- `just test-python` — the embedded Python scripts, which cargo does not compile and therefore
  does not cover. `tests/python/`, stdlib `unittest`, no dependencies and nothing to install:
  keep it that way, so the suite stays runnable wherever a `python3` is. The preflight gate's
  tests dial a real listener rather than feeding a parser byte strings — what the gate exists to
  judge is wire behaviour, and a fake would only test the half that was never in doubt.
- `managed_ssh::container_tests` is an `#[ignore]`d testcontainers test that boots the real
  proxy sshd image and asserts per-run cert isolation (INV-4). It needs a Docker/Podman socket
  and an `ssh` client; it validates cert *logic*, not the on-cluster Secret-mount permissions
  (that's what the `StrictModes no` unit assertion guards — see the test's doc comment).
- `cargo clippy` is clean and there's no `clippy.toml`; keep it clean (a scoped
  `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` on `ensure_proxy_infra` is the only deliberate
  exception). Run `cargo build` + `cargo test` + `cargo clippy` before proposing changes — and
  the guide build (`just docs`) if you touched `docs/` or user-facing behaviour/CRDs/chart.
  `just check` runs everything (build + both test suites + clippy + guide + apidoc); see the
  `Justfile` for recipes.
- `./ansible-operator crds` dumps all **five** CRDs (PlaybookPlan, Play, ClusterInventory,
  StaticInventory, NodeAccessPolicy) — check this path after changing any `CustomResource` type.
  **A doc comment on a CRD type becomes Helm template text.** `just generate-crds` copies the dump
  into `chart/charts/crds/templates/` verbatim, escaping nothing, so a `{{ … }}` in a doc comment is
  a live Helm action: an example of Helm syntax renders as its *result* in the shipped CRD (a
  `{{ .Chart.Version | replace … }}` sample became `0.1.0`), and an expression Helm cannot evaluate
  fails the install outright. Describe such syntax in prose, and check with
  `helm template ./chart | grep` after regenerating.
- The chart renders `managedSsh.proxyImage` and `watchNamespaces` into the operator ConfigMap;
  `helm template ./chart -s templates/configmap.yaml` (and `templates/role.yaml`) is the quick
  way to sanity-check chart wiring.
- CI (`.github/workflows/build-test-push.yml`): `cargo test` and the Python suite as separate
  parallel jobs, + `cargo build --release`, then a Containerfile distroless image (binary copied
  in, no cargo build inside the image).
- `.agents/skills/` is a vendored skill pack (rust-skills), unrelated to this project's domain —
  not something to modify as part of feature work.
