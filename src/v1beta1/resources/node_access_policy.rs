/// `ClusterInventory` confers node-root (its managed-ssh proxy pods run with hostPID + nsenter), so
/// any namespace allowed to create one could otherwise target *any* node. A `NodeAccessPolicy` maps
/// a set of namespaces to a *ceiling* set of nodes; a `ClusterInventory`'s resolved nodes are
/// intersected with that ceiling before any proxy infra is created.

///
/// The policy is authored by whoever can write to the operator namespace (the cluster admin) — a
/// different principal than the tenant who authors the `ClusterInventory`. Enforcement is an
/// intersection, so it can only ever *shrink* a tenant's node set: a forged or buggy request can
/// never reach a node the policy didn't grant.
///

/// A namespace with no matching policy resolves to zero allowed nodes. An empty selector (`{}`)
/// matches *nothing*, not everything — to grant all nodes, match a ubiquitous label explicitly,
/// e.g. `matchExpressions: [{ key: kubernetes.io/hostname, operator: Exists }]`. The effective
/// allow-set for a namespace is the union across every policy whose `namespaceSelector` matches it.
