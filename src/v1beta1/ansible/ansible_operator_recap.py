callback: ansible_operator_recap
type: notification
short_description: Emits a machine-readable per-host outcome summary for ansible-operator.
description:
  - Hooks the same playbook-stats event the default callback uses, without replacing it, so
    human-readable stdout (the PLAY RECAP) is unaffected.
  - At end of run, writes a compact JSON map to the container's termination-message file
    (/dev/termination-log). ansible-operator reads it back from the finished container's
    terminated state instead of scraping logs, since one Job can span many hosts and its own
    exit code no longer maps to any single host's result.
  - 'Format: {"<host>": [ok, changed, unreachable, failed, skipped, rescued, ignored, completed],
    ...} — a fixed-order array per host, no spaces. The last element is 1 when the host reached the
    operator''s completion marker.'
  - The kubelet caps that message at 4096 bytes, so a fleet large enough to exceed it is written
    deflated and base64-encoded behind a `z:` prefix instead. See TERMINATION_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES.
requirements:
  - Enabled via ANSIBLE_CALLBACKS_ENABLED (this callback sets CALLBACK_NEEDS_ENABLED).

# survived (12 KiB split evenly, see job_builder.rs). Either way an oversized recap does not arrive
# partial — it arrives as invalid JSON, and the operator can only report every host `Unknown` and
# spend the run's whole attempt budget re-producing it. So the prefixes below are readable only
# because nothing here ever writes past the cap, never because of where they sit.

    """Renders the recap for the termination message, compressing only if it would not fit.

    Staying with plain JSON while it fits is deliberate: it keeps the message readable with a bare
    `kubectl get pod -o jsonpath=...` for every cluster small enough that someone would try, and it
    keeps the compressed path off the hot path for the common case. Above the cap, the recap is
    highly redundant — repeated node-name prefixes and long runs of zero counters — so deflate buys
    roughly 3-5x, which moves the ceiling from ~60 hosts into the hundreds.

    Past even that, a marker naming the host count is written instead. It costs the same per-host
    detail an unwritable message costs, but it is the difference between the operator reporting
    "the recap could not be read" and reporting why — and the operator cannot work it out for
    itself, since an overflowed message and a crashed one are equally unparseable.
