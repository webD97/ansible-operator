/// Emits one tick whenever a watched object's **labels** change, it appears, or it disappears —
/// and stays silent for every other update.
///
/// This exists for the controllers whose status is a function of a whole *selected set*
/// (`ClusterInventory` over Nodes, `NodeAccessPolicy` over Nodes and Namespaces). Their triggers
/// used to map any event on a watched object to *every* object they own, which was correct and
/// ruinously loud: kubelets repost Node status roughly every five minutes
/// (`nodeStatusReportFrequency`) and every one of those reposts recomputed a byte-identical status,
/// each recomputation costing a cluster-wide `list_metadata` and a status patch. The load was
/// `nodes × 12/hour × (inventories + policies)`, roughly quadratic in cluster size, for zero change
/// in output.
///
/// A status repost never touches labels, so hashing them is the whole filter — but only because
/// **labels are exactly what the selectors read**: `nodeselector::node_matches` and
/// `nodeselector::selector_matches_fail_closed` consult `metadata.labels` and nothing else. A
/// selector term that ever reads a taint, an annotation or a spec field would be invisible to this
/// trigger and would silently stop reaching its controller, so the two have to move together.
///
/// The event kind is why this is a hand-built stream rather than `Controller::watches` with a
/// narrower mapper, or `WatchStreamExt::predicate_filter`. Both of those see only the object:
/// `trigger_others` flattens `watcher::Event` through `touched_objects()`, and a deleted object
/// still carries the labels it matched with, so either would treat a deletion as "nothing changed"
/// and leave a departed Node in the inventory until the hourly requeue — during which plans target
/// a machine that no longer exists. `Controller::reconcile_all_on` takes a prepared stream, so the
/// filter can be written where `Event::Delete` is still distinguishable.
///
/// Call sites pass an `Api<PartialObjectMeta<K>>`, which kube turns into metadata-only requests: the
/// label map is all this reads and all the reconciles it wakes read, so the apiserver sends
/// `PartialObjectMetadata` instead of whole Nodes, roughly a tenth of the bytes per event.
