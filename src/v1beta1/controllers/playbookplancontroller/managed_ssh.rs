/// Container-backed integration test for the R3 cross-run isolation property: a *real* sshd (the
/// production proxy image) configured entirely by `build_secret`/`render_sshd_config` must accept

/// principal check, with the per-run NetworkPolicy out of the picture. It also exercises the host
/// cert / `@cert-authority` known_hosts path.
///
/// NOTE: this test injects config via copy-to-container (a normal root-owned image-layer directory),
/// so it does *not* reproduce the Kubernetes Secret tmpfs mount whose permissions make sshd's
/// `secure_filename` refuse the `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile` under the default `StrictModes yes` — the
/// real-cluster failure that forced `StrictModes no` in `render_sshd_config`. It therefore validates
/// the principal *logic*, not the on-cluster mount permissions; keep the `StrictModes no` unit
/// assertion as the guard for the latter.
///
/// `#[ignore]`d by default — it needs a Docker/Podman API socket and an OpenSSH `ssh` client on the
/// runner. With rootless podman (`systemctl --user start podman.socket`), run:
///   ```text
///   export DOCKER_HOST="unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/podman/podman.sock" \
///   export TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true \
///   cargo test managed_ssh::container_tests -- --ignored --nocapture
///   ```
/// (Ryuk — testcontainers' reaper sidecar — is flaky under rootless podman; disabling it is safe
/// here because `ContainerAsync`'s `Drop` removes the proxy container at test end.)
///
/// SELinux / rootless-podman note: the sshd config files are injected with testcontainers'
/// copy-to-container, so they land in the container's own image layer — owned by container-root and
/// labeled `container_file_t` automatically. A host bind mount would instead need `:Z` relabeling on
/// an SELinux-enforcing host *and* would carry the host uid, which sshd's StrictModes rejects as bad
/// ownership on `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile`/the host key. Copy-to sidesteps both, matching prod's
/// root-owned read-only Secret mount.
