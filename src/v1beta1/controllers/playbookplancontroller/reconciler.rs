/// Blocks until the Node reflector has served its initial LIST, and **panics** if it never does.
///
/// The wait itself is what `node_readiness` depends on: an unsynced cache reports every node
/// `Ready`, because [`node_readiness::unready_nodes`] reads a miss as "no such Node". That is
/// precisely the answer that starts the runs a held plan exists to hold back — each one taking its
/// hosts' Leases, creating a node-root proxy pod per host, waiting out the full grace window
/// (default 600s) while blocking every other plan on those hosts, and then reporting them all
/// unreachable. Without this wait that is what an operator restart costs every held plan.
///
/// **Failing to sync is fatal, not degraded, and that is the whole reason for the panic.**
/// `Store::wait_until_ready` resolves on exactly two events — the cache is populated, or the writer
/// is dropped — and a `watcher` retries a failing watch forever, so an apiserver that never answers
/// leaves this pending for the life of the process. Since `main` builds this controller inside its
/// own future, the other two would carry on and the operator would look healthy while every plan in
/// the cluster silently stopped moving, with only the reflector task's own log line to say why.
/// Crashing is louder, and it recovers on its own if the cause was transient.
///
/// A dropped writer is fatal for the same reason and not merely a warning: the writer lives in the
/// reflector task, so losing it means the cache will never populate *and* never update again.
///
/// **This bounds the first sync only, and the same failure after it is not covered.** A watch that
/// breaks once the cache is populated leaves the `Store` serving its last contents indefinitely, so
/// the gate keeps answering — from a snapshot. The effect is the pre-gate behaviour the branch was
/// written to remove, arriving quietly: a Node that goes down afterwards still reads `Ready`, so a
/// run starts against it, takes its hosts' Leases, waits out the grace window and reports everything
/// unreachable; and a held plan is released by nothing but its hourly requeue.
///
/// It is deliberately not treated the same way, because the two failures are not alike. Here there
/// is no answer at all and never has been, so refusing to start is strictly better than guessing.
/// There, the operator is running with an answer that was true a moment ago and degrades from there,
/// and every way of acting on that trades one failure for another: crashing turns a self-healing
/// apiserver blip into a restart loop, and holding every run instead would stop a fleet on the
/// strength of a watch error. Which trade is right is a decision nobody has had to make yet, so the
/// reflector task escalates its log after [`NODE_WATCH_FAILURES_BEFORE_ESCALATING`], repeats it
/// every [`NODE_WATCH_ESCALATION_INTERVAL`] and says when the watch recovers, and nothing more —
/// making the state loud, which is the half that was missing, without picking a trade on a
/// cluster's behalf.
