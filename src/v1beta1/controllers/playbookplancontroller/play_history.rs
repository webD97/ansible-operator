//! Writes and prunes `Play` recovery/history records. A Play is a durable, per-run receipt of
//! one Ansible run. It begins before Job creation, so a run abandoned during preparation has
//! no backing Job; once launched, it is 1:1 with its Job. Run identity survives status-write failures
//! and the recap survives the Job/pod's short TTL. Retention is bounded by the history limits.
//!
//! The PlaybookPlan reconciler drives the state machine these functions implement, one step per
//! call, each written down before the thing it describes is created:
//!
//! ```text
//! record_prepared  -> Prepared    nothing exists for the run yet; freely abortable
//! commit_starting  -> Starting    host Leases held, privileged proxy infra being built
//! commit_launching -> Launching   live authorization passed; Job creation is committed
//! record_running   -> Running     the Job has been created or independently observed
//! record_finished  -> Succeeded | Failed | Unknown
//! abort_unlaunched -> Aborted     superseded (or deauthorized) before its Job existed
//! ```
//!
//! Phases are not simply monotonic — `Aborted` is a terminal-but-not-finished side exit whose
//! record must outlive its own cleanup, since that record is what keeps the cleanup retryable.
//! Every transition reads the object fresh and writes it back through `replace_status`, so it
//! carries a `resourceVersion` precondition; `decide_transition` makes replaying a step that
//! already landed a no-op, while a record that moved somewhere else entirely fails loudly. Losing
//! that precondition (a 409) is not a failure but a stale read, so `transition_phase` re-reads and
//! re-decides once rather than surfacing it to the reconciler as an error.

/// inflates every host's `ok`, and the hosts the run excluded are missing entirely. Nor is it a sum

/// Ansible processed that is not an inventory host of the plan: the implicit localhost of a
/// `hosts: localhost` play, an `add_host` target.
///
/// So it is summed from two sources, one per kind of host:
///
/// - the parsed recap, which is already the author's own counters — the callback subtracts the
///   marker's `ok` per host, gated on the same per-host flag that records it, so a host that never
///   ran the marker has nothing subtracted;
/// - one `unreachable` per excluded host, which no recap can supply: the run passed
///   `--limit '!<host>'`, so Ansible never processed it and never counted it. Without this the total
///   would claim the run reached every host it targeted.
///
/// The two cannot overlap, which is what makes adding them safe: `--limit` keeps an excluded host
/// out of every play, so it is never in `processed` — not even if the playbook `add_host`s a host of
/// that name, since the limit still applies to it. A run that excluded *everything* has no recap at
/// all and falls out as `0 + N`, which is again what the user's own playbook would print with every
/// host down.
///
/// The consequence is that the total can exceed what the rows in `.status.hosts` account for, and
/// that is correct rather than an inconsistency: `hostCount` counts the hosts the run targeted while
/// the recap counts what the playbook did, and a `localhost` play has made those differ for as long
/// as playbooks have had one.

///   `Ready` heartbeat is exactly what fixes that. `Unreachable`, which is in the Node watch's wake

/// - the Node was `Ready` and its proxy pod never came up anyway — an untolerated taint, a failing
///   image pull, a rejecting admission webhook. The Node is already `Ready`, so no Node event will
///   ever resolve it; only the pod spec will. `NotReached` — the same answer `mappers` gives a host
///   a `serial` batch stopped short of, and for the same reason: this host's own heartbeats carry no

///   whole life, re-resolving both inventory kinds, re-reading every referenced Secret and listing
///   every Node, long after the attempt budget stopped it acting.

/// Both keep `unreachable: 1` in the recap: the counter records that nothing connected, which is
