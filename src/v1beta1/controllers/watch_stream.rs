/// The watch stream every reflector and trigger in this operator is built on: a [`watcher()`] that

///
/// `watcher` resumes. On an error it hands the error up and keeps the state it had — including, in
/// `State::Watching`, the very HTTP response body that produced the error. The next poll does not
/// re-request anything; it reads the next line out of that same response. That is only a subtlety
/// until the response is an error body, because `kube_client`'s watch path never checks the HTTP
/// status (`Client::request_events`, unlike `Client::request_text`, does not call
/// `handle_api_errors`) and instead frames the body by lines and parses each one as a `WatchEvent`.
/// A compact single-line `Status` is recovered by a fallback and reported as one API error; a
/// **pretty-printed** one is not, and becomes one `SerdeError` per line.
///
/// That is not hypothetical: a k3s apiserver that restarts answers the metadata watches
/// (`selector_trigger::label_changes`, which asks for `PartialObjectMetadata`) with a pretty-printed
/// `403` while its RBAC is still loading. Resuming turned that single 403 into a dozen stream
/// errors, each one paying a full backoff delay, so the operator spent five and a half minutes
/// reading an error message it had already received — four of them after the apiserver was healthy
/// again. Restarting discards the body with the watcher, so one bad response costs exactly one
/// error.
///
/// Restarting also settles the other half of that incident. A resumed watch re-asks from the
/// `resourceVersion` it last saw, which after an apiserver restart is far enough behind to be
/// refused with `410 Expired` — another error, another delay, before the re-LIST that was always
/// going to be needed. A rebuilt watcher LISTs first, so there is no stale version to be refused.
///
/// The cost is a full re-LIST per error, which is what `client-go`'s reflector has always done. It
/// is bounded by the backoff below, and it is not paid on the routine path: the apiserver closing a
/// watch at its 290s timeout ends the body cleanly, which `watcher` reports as no event at all and

/// `Controller::run` wraps every trigger stream it has in a single `StreamBackoff`, and while that
/// waits it polls none of them. A delay is therefore paid per **error**, not per stream, and the
/// streams take turns: eleven streams reporting one error each is charged exactly as eleven errors
/// from one stream. kube's 30 s ceiling is chosen for a stream that has a delay to itself, so
/// sharing it between the `PlaybookPlan` controller's eleven streams throttles each of them to one
/// attempt every five and a half minutes — eleven times more conservative than kube intends — and
/// makes any recovery that needs one error from every stream take just as long. An apiserver
/// restart is exactly that recovery, twice over: each stream reports the death of its response body
/// and then the `410 Expired` its resumed watch earns. The controller spent 13m49s of it
/// rediscovering an apiserver that had been healthy since the first thirteen seconds.
///
/// Dividing restores kube's intent on both counts at once. Each stream is still retried about twice
/// a minute while the apiserver is away, and a recovery that needs one error per stream now costs
/// about as long as one stream's ceiling rather than one per stream — so the two errors a restart
/// costs every stream are paid off in about two ceilings, a minute or so, whatever the divisor.
///
/// **The division stops at [`FLOOR`].** Holding the per-stream rate constant means the controller's
/// own rate grows with its stream count, and an install with enough enrolled namespaces would answer
/// an apiserver that is already down with several requests a second and a `warn!` line for each.
/// Past about thirty-seven streams the ceiling is the floor instead, which bounds that at one
/// request every 800 ms and pays for it in recovery time — linear in the stream count from there,
/// about five minutes for a hundred enrolled namespaces.
///

/// step, and there is one of these driving one merged stream. That does make this the more
/// aggressive policy by about half, since kube's jitter is additive and its 30 s ceiling is really
