/// The watch stream every reflector and trigger in this operator is built on: a [`watcher()`] that
/// is **thrown away and rebuilt from a fresh LIST after any error**, rather than resumed.
///
/// `watcher` resumes. On an error it hands the error up and keeps the state it had — including, in
/// `State::Watching`, the very HTTP response body that produced the error. The next poll does not
/// re-request anything; it reads the next line out of that same response. That is only a subtlety
/// until the response is an error body, because `kube_client`'s watch path never checks the HTTP
/// status (`Client::request_events`, unlike `Client::request_text`, does not call
/// `handle_api_errors`) and instead frames the body by lines and parses each one as a `WatchEvent`.
/// A compact single-line `Status` is recovered by a fallback and reported as one API error; a
/// **pretty-printed** one is not, and becomes one `SerdeError` per line.
///
/// That is not hypothetical: a k3s apiserver that restarts answers the metadata watches
/// (`selector_trigger::label_changes`, which asks for `PartialObjectMetadata`) with a pretty-printed
/// `403` while its RBAC is still loading. Resuming turned that single 403 into a dozen stream
/// errors, each one paying a full backoff delay, so the operator spent five and a half minutes
/// reading an error message it had already received — four of them after the apiserver was healthy
/// again. Restarting discards the body with the watcher, so one bad response costs exactly one
/// error.
///
/// Restarting also settles the other half of that incident. A resumed watch re-asks from the
/// `resourceVersion` it last saw, which after an apiserver restart is far enough behind to be
/// refused with `410 Expired` — another error, another delay, before the re-LIST that was always
/// going to be needed. A rebuilt watcher LISTs first, so there is no stale version to be refused.
///
/// The cost is a full re-LIST per error, which is what `client-go`'s reflector has always done. It
/// is bounded by the backoff below, and it is not paid on the routine path: the apiserver closing a
/// watch at its 290s timeout ends the body cleanly, which `watcher` reports as no event at all and
/// resumes from — not as an error.

/// second for as long as it fails, with an `error!` line each time; only a failing *watch*, resumed
/// from a resourceVersion without an `Init`, ever grows its delay.
///
/// What is left is `DefaultBackoff`'s own reset, once two minutes pass between errors. A watch that
/// recovers and fails again inside that window resumes at the delay it had reached instead of the
/// floor: slower to retry a second blip, which is the price of not being reset by an item that
