# Scheduling and execution modes

Two independent things decide *when* a plan runs and *what* runs:

- the **schedule** (and time zone) decides at which wall-clock times a run may fire;
- the **execution mode** plus **drift detection** decide which hosts actually execute when a run does
  fire.

## Schedule

`spec.schedule` is a standard **5-field cron** expression (`minute hour day-of-month month
day-of-week`). `spec.timeZone` is the IANA time zone it is evaluated in; if omitted, **UTC** is used.
The granularity is minutes, not seconds. Schedules with a seconds or year field are not accepted.
Invalid cron expressions, unknown time zones, and expressions with no future occurrence are rejected;
the plan does not run until the field is corrected. Its status identifies the invalid field; see
[The plan's schedule or time zone is
invalid](./results-and-troubleshooting.md#the-plans-schedule-or-time-zone-is-invalid).

The operator evaluates the schedule on its own reconcile cycle rather than exactly on the tick, so a
run starts within a short window *after* each scheduled time. `spec.startingDeadlineSeconds` sets how
wide that window is: if the run has not started within this many seconds of the tick — because the
operator was busy or restarting — that tick is skipped and the run waits for the next one. It
defaults to **30** seconds. Raise it for a plan that must not miss a tick even if the operator is
briefly down at the scheduled time. This is the same idea as a CronJob's `.spec.startingDeadlineSeconds`.

```yaml
spec:
  schedule: "0 3 * * *"          # 03:00 every day
  timeZone: Europe/Berlin        # ...in Berlin local time (honours DST)
  startingDeadlineSeconds: 300   # still fire if the operator catches up within 5 minutes
```

**Omitting `schedule`** means "eligible to run as soon as possible", not "never": the plan is not
gated on a clock and runs when its hosts are out of date. Use an explicit schedule when you want runs
pinned to a maintenance window.

The plan's `.status.nextRun` shows the next computed fire time, and the `Next run` printer column
surfaces it in `kubectl get playbookplan`.

### One tick, one run per revision

Because a run may start anywhere inside that window, the trigger gate has to remember that the window
has already been used — otherwise a run finishing inside its own window would immediately re-trigger
itself. The gate uses the attempt budget's `.status.retryCountSlot` and the plan's immutable `Play`
records to identify the current tick. `.status.lastTriggeredRun` records the tick a run was last
started for as an observable marker only; it is not a gate input.

That gating state is per revision, not per window: any change to the [execution hash](#drift-detection)
clears the retry budget and makes prior `Play` records inapplicable, so an edit made moments after a
run started takes effect right away rather than waiting for the next tick. `lastTriggeredRun` is
cleared with the revision as an informational status update. Reverting to an earlier revision is a
change like any other and runs again too.

Every run writes down the revision and schedule tick before anything is created, so before the
operator starts a run for a tick it checks whether one of the plan's own
[`Play` records](./results-and-troubleshooting.md) already took that tick at the current revision.
The slot-scoped attempt counter remains after old records are pruned. Together they keep a lagging or
competing status write from granting an extra attempt; `lastTriggeredRun` remains a summary for
observers rather than another source of gating decisions.

## Suspending a plan

Set `spec.suspend: true` to stop the operator starting new runs, the same idea as a CronJob's
`.spec.suspend`. It is a pause switch, not a delete:

- A run whose **Job already exists** is left to finish — suspending never kills a running Job.
- A run that has **not created its Job yet** — one still waiting for its host locks, or still
  bringing up its proxy pods — is dropped instead: nothing irrevocable exists for it, so pausing the
  plan stops it rather than letting it launch whenever it becomes able to. It is cleaned up and
  deleted the same way a run superseded by an edit is, and a fresh run starts once you
  resume. See [Editing a plan while a run is in
  flight](#editing-a-plan-while-a-run-is-in-flight).
- No **new** run is started while suspended, in any mode: a `Recurring` plan skips its schedule
  ticks, and a `OneShot` plan holds off even when hosts are out of date.
- The `Suspended` printer column reads `true` and `.status.nextRun` is cleared — there is no next run
  while paused. The plan's phase keeps showing its underlying state (e.g. `Delayed` or
  `Succeeded`); the column, not the phase, is what tells you it is paused.

Clear the flag (`spec.suspend: false`, or remove it) to resume; a `Recurring` plan picks up again at
its next scheduled tick. Suspending does not pause drift detection — editing the playbook or a
referenced Secret while suspended still updates the current hash, so the run that eventually resumes
reflects the latest inputs.

## Execution modes

`spec.mode` is one of:

### `OneShot` (default)

Converge to a goal state and then stop. Only **out-of-date** hosts run; once every host has succeeded
on the current playbook and inputs, the plan settles into `Succeeded` and stops — it does **not** keep
re-running on the schedule. A run that fails is tried again a bounded number of times (see
[Retries](#retries)); once that budget is spent the plan settles into `Failed` and stops the same way.
Either way it wakes again only when the inputs change (see drift detection below). Good for "make it so": apply a configuration
or a one-time migration and confirm every host got it.

### `Recurring`

Re-apply on **every** schedule tick. *All* hosts run each time, regardless of whether they ran
successfully last time. Between ticks the phase keeps the latest run's `Succeeded` or `Failed`
result, while `.status.nextRun` names the next tick. Good for periodic enforcement or inherently
repeating work: nightly package upgrades, drift correction, health tasks. A `Recurring` plan needs a
`schedule`.

## Drift detection

To decide which hosts are out of date, the operator computes an **execution hash** over the playbook
text, **the contents of every referenced Secret** (variables and files), the group variables set
by the inventories the plan references
([cluster nodes](./cluster-nodes.md#group-variables), [external hosts](./external-hosts.md#group-variables)),
and the version in [`spec.provides`](./playbook-plans.md#declaring-what-a-plan-provides) if the plan
declares one.
The hash is order-insensitive, so reordering inputs does not count as a change, and it excludes the
internally rendered workspace, whose content (e.g. proxy pod IPs) legitimately changes every run.

The inventories contribute their `variables` only, keyed by group name, so a group that sets none —
omitting the field or writing an empty `{}`, which render identically — contributes nothing at all.
Which *hosts* a group resolves to is deliberately not part of the hash: a
node joining or leaving changes who the plan targets, not what it applies, and a new node is already
out of date because it has no recorded hash of its own.

- Each host records the hash it **last succeeded on** (`.status.hostsStatus.<host>.lastAppliedHash`).
- A host whose last-applied hash equals the current hash is **current** and is skipped (in
  `OneShot`).
- A host whose Node was **replaced** — deleted and re-registered under the same name, e.g. a
  re-imaged machine or a rolled node pool — is outdated again, whatever it last applied. The record
  is keyed by the host's name, which is all the fresh machine inherits, so the operator compares the
  Node's `creationTimestamp` against the host's
  [`appliedAt`](./results-and-troubleshooting.md#per-host-outcomes) to tell the two apart.
- When you edit the playbook or change a referenced variables/files Secret, the hash changes **at
  once**: the operator watches the plan and the Secrets it names, so the desired hash, run numbering
  and [consumed schedule slot](#one-tick-one-run-per-revision) update on the spot.
- Changing `spec.provides.version` changes the hash, so the playbook re-runs on **every** host of
  the plan. That is what lets a Node's dependency label be trusted, and it is also the only way to
  re-run a plan whose playbook text has not changed. Adding or removing `provides` re-runs it once.
- Changing an inventory's group variables changes the hash at once too, and for the same reason —
  the operator watches the `ClusterInventory` and `StaticInventory` resources a plan names. The same
  goes for the hosts a group resolves to: a Node joining, leaving or being relabelled updates the
  `ClusterInventory`'s `.status.resolvedHosts` within seconds, and that update reaches every plan
  built on it immediately.
- Being woken is not the same as running. What updates on the spot is the plan's *view* — its
  desired hash, `.status.eligibleHosts` and summary. Whether a run then starts is still the
  schedule's decision: an unscheduled `OneShot` plan starts one right away, while a scheduled plan
  of either mode waits for its next tick.
- An in-flight run keeps its own hash, target inventory, run number, and schedule slot in an
  immutable `Play`, so none of these edits disturb it — see [Editing a plan while a run is in
  flight](#editing-a-plan-while-a-run-is-in-flight).

This is what makes `OneShot` idempotent and cheap: editing an unrelated field does not re-run
everything, but a real change to the playbook or its inputs does. The current hash is visible as
`.status.currentHash` and in the `Current hash` printer column.

### What wakes a plan

A plan is re-evaluated whenever one of the things it is built from changes, and otherwise on a
timer. The watched inputs are:

| Change | Reaches the plan |
|---|---|
| The `PlaybookPlan` itself | at once |
| A Secret it names in `variables` or `files` | at once |
| A `ClusterInventory` or `StaticInventory` it names — including the Nodes a `ClusterInventory` resolves to | at once |
| A `NodeAccessPolicy` (which may change [which Nodes the namespace may target](../cluster-operators/node-access-policies.md)) | at once |
| A Node it is still waiting on becoming `Ready` | at once, for a `OneShot` plan |
| A `StaticInventory`'s SSH key Secret | at once, but **only for a plan whose last run did not succeed** |
| The run's Job finishing | at once |
| Nothing at all | on a timer: the time until the next scheduled tick, or an hour for an unscheduled plan |

"Still waiting on" is narrower than "not current". For a host whose `lastAppliedHash` differs from
the current hash, a Node turning `Ready` wakes a plan if it has never run against that host, left it
[unreachable](./cluster-nodes.md#holding-instead-of-starting), could not read its recap, or last
succeeded on an older revision. It does **not** wake a plan for a host left `Failed`, `NotReached`,
or `Incomplete`: none of those outcomes says that host's own Node returning to `Ready` can unblock
the plan. See the [per-host outcome table](./results-and-troubleshooting.md#per-host-outcomes) for
their distinct causes.

It also asks whether the *plan* could act on the wake-up at all, which is a separate question from
what its hosts need. Three answers say it could not, and none of them is something a Node supplies:

- a **suspended** plan is waiting on you, not on a machine, so no Node wakes it however outdated its
  hosts are — resuming it is what starts the run.
- a `OneShot` plan that has spent its [attempts](#retries) may not start another run, so a Node
  turning `Ready` under it changes nothing until the budget comes back — which an edit, a
  `StaticInventory` SSH key rotation or a successful run does, and each of those has its own row in
  the table above.
- a **`Recurring`** plan is started by its schedule and by nothing else, so a Node is never what it
  is waiting for: it runs at its next tick against whatever it can reach then, and it is never
  [held](./cluster-nodes.md#holding-instead-of-starting) in the meantime. A Node returning early
  brings its tick no closer.

The SSH key row is deliberately one-sided. Rotating a key changes how the operator connects, not what
it applies, so it must never re-apply the playbook to hosts that are already current — which is why
the key is not part of the execution hash, and the hash is what decides which hosts are outdated. A
plan that succeeded therefore ignores the rotation entirely.

A plan whose last run **failed** is the opposite case: the old key may well be why it failed, so
rotating it is a fix. Because that plan has usually spent its [attempts](#retries) by then — a
`StaticInventory` host has no proxy wait in front of it, so the tries burn in seconds — waking it
alone would achieve nothing, and the rotation restores the plan's attempt budget as well. The run
that follows still only targets the hosts that are not up to date, since `lastAppliedHash` is
untouched.

Two details worth knowing:

- **The first key a plan ever sees is not a rotation.** A plan created before this behaviour existed,
  or one reaching a `StaticInventory` for the first time, records the key it finds without acting on
  it. Only a *change* from a key the plan already recorded counts.
- **A rotation during a run waits for it.** The run in flight finishes against the key it started
  with, and the rotation is acted on once its result is in.

## Editing a plan while a run is in flight

You can edit a plan at any time; you never have to wait for a run to finish. What happens to the run
already in progress depends on whether its Job has been created yet. That is never assumed: the
operator asks the API server directly, and asks again immediately before giving up on a run, so
a Job that only became visible in between is still found and adopted rather than having its
infrastructure torn down underneath it.

**A run whose Job exists keeps going.** It finishes the playbook it started, against the hosts it
started with, and its results are recorded against the revision it actually ran. The operator does not
kill it, swap its playbook underneath it, or attribute its recap to your new revision. Your edit takes
effect on the next run.

**A run whose Job does not exist yet is abandoned.** A run that is still waiting for host locks,
still bringing up its proxy pods, or committed but not yet launched is dropped in favour of the new
revision: its locks are released and any proxy infrastructure it had started building is cleaned up.
It is deleted rather than reported as a failed or unknown execution, and it is never retried — there
is no point applying a revision you have already replaced. A fresh run then starts for the plan as
it now reads.

This second case is triggered by more than the execution hash. An unlaunched run is abandoned
whenever *any* part of the plan spec changes — the image, tolerations, verbosity, inventory
references — or when the set of nodes the plan resolves to changes, for instance because a node was
relabelled or a `NodeAccessPolicy` was narrowed. The hash decides which hosts are out of date; this
check decides whether a run still matches the plan it was prepared for, and it is deliberately
the stricter of the two. Setting `spec.suspend: true` has the same effect, for the same reason:
nothing irrevocable exists for an unlaunched run, so a paused plan drops it instead of launching
it later.

One trigger is narrower than the rest. A run that is still waiting for its **host locks** is
also dropped if it misses its schedule window, because it has yet to consume the slot it was started
for. That gate lifts as soon as the locks are held: bringing up proxy pods routinely takes longer
than `startingDeadlineSeconds`, so keeping it would leave a scheduled plan unable to launch at all.

An absent-Job run is also abandoned when something it references no longer exists — one of its
inventories, or a Secret named by `spec.template.variables`/`files` — or when an inventory group
contains an operator-reserved connection variable: there is no executable desired state left to
resume it against. A run that had already committed to launching is re-checked first, and if its
Job does exist by then it is adopted and allowed to finish like any other started run — a broken
reference belongs to the *next* revision, not to a run that is already under way. A transient failure
reading otherwise valid inventory, policy or Secret data abandons nothing at all; it only pauses
recovery, with the run's host locks kept alive, rather than launching from incomplete input.

The distinction matters because holding a run is not free: its host locks keep being renewed for
as long as it is held, so a run waiting on something that is never coming back would block every
other plan targeting those hosts indefinitely. A missing reference is therefore resolved rather than
waited on.

The practical consequence: repeatedly editing a plan while its runs are still starting up can keep
starting fresh runs. That is intentional — each abandoned run is cleaned up and costs nothing
but the setup time — but if you are making a series of edits, `spec.suspend` is the tidier way to
batch them.

## Run numbers

Two runs of an unchanged plan produce the same execution hash, so the hash alone cannot tell their
Jobs apart. Each run therefore gets a number, and the Job is named `apply-<plan>-<id>-<n>`. Run
numbers are reserved across the plan as a whole, not per execution hash: each is one past every Job
and retained `Play` record that still claims a number. The hash suffix can be shared by different
revisions, so numbering continues across an edit rather than restarting at 1.

The number exists to keep names unique, and that is all it promises. It is not a dense count of the
plan's runs — a run abandoned before its Job was created can leave its number unused — and
`.status.lastRunNumber` is the highest number handed out so far, not a count of how often the
current revision has been tried. You generally do not interact with either.

A Job's name is capped at 63 characters by Kubernetes, so the plan-name portion is shortened to fit.
The rest of the name — `apply-`, the id and the run number — takes 19 characters at a
single-digit run, leaving 44: a plan named 45 characters or more is shortened, and one more
character goes each time the run number gains a digit. The `Play` shares the shortened name, so
the two always match.

## Retries

A run that fails is tried again, up to `spec.maxAttempts` tries counting the first one — so
`maxAttempts: 1` means no retry at all. Each try is a run in its own right: its own Job, its own
`Play` record, its own run number. `.status.retryCount` says how many of the budget the plan has
spent so far, `.status.retryCountSlot` identifies the schedule tick that count belongs to, and the
`Play`'s `Try` column (`kubectl get plays -o wide`) says which try each run was.

What the budget covers depends on the mode, because what counts as "the same piece of work" does:

- **`OneShot`** spends its budget on the current playbook and inputs, and defaults to `3`. Once it is
  spent the plan stays `Failed` and starts nothing further — that is the point: its hosts are still
  out of date precisely *because* the runs failed, so nothing else would stop it. Editing the
  playbook or a referenced Secret changes the execution hash and hands it a fresh budget; so does
  raising `maxAttempts`. A successful run also closes that execution and resets the budget, so hosts
  added to the inventory later can run without an unrelated plan edit — and so does a run whose only
  non-successes were hosts on Nodes that were already `NotReady` when it launched, since every host
  it could reach did succeed (see [Unreachable Nodes and the attempt
  budget](./cluster-nodes.md#unreachable-nodes-and-the-attempt-budget)). A `schedule` does not reset a
  failed execution: it says when a `OneShot` plan may run, not how often it may fail.
- **`Recurring`** spends its budget on one schedule tick, and defaults to `1` — no retry, since the
  next tick re-applies the same playbook anyway. With a higher `maxAttempts` a failed run is retried
  within the current tick, and the next tick starts over with a full budget whatever the previous one
  did. Retries are still bound by `startingDeadlineSeconds` (see above), measured from the original
  schedule tick rather than from the time an attempt fails. Every retry must start before that
  original deadline, so time spent running earlier attempts counts against the window. With the
  default 30 seconds, a first attempt that runs for longer than 30 seconds cannot be retried. When
  setting `maxAttempts` above `1`, set `startingDeadlineSeconds` long enough to cover the expected
  duration of earlier attempts and reconciliation between them; otherwise the plan waits for the
  next tick with its unused tries.

A run that never got as far as its Job — one given up because the plan was edited, suspended, missed
its window, or lost a host lock — is not a failed try, but it does consume a run number. If the same
scheduled execution can still start, as after a host-lock takeover clears within its grace window,
the unspent attempt remains available. Giving up a retry restores the preceding `Failed` verdict;
giving up an execution's first attempt leaves the plan `Pending` because it has no verdict yet.

## Dependencies do not re-trigger a plan

A dependency label says "this plan **may** run here", never "this plan **must** run again because
the provider changed". When a plan you depend on publishes a new version, your plan is not re-run:
its hosts are still on its own current revision, so nothing about it is out of date. If you need the
provider's new behaviour, give your own plan a new revision — edit it, or narrow its inventory's
selector to the new version, which changes what it targets.

One consequence to watch for with `OneShot`: a plan whose attempt budget is already spent starts
nothing at all, **including for hosts that become eligible later**. So if your plan burned through
`maxAttempts` while its provider was still working through the fleet, it will not pick up the Nodes
that were labelled afterwards. That is deliberate — a playbook that is failing should be fixed
before it reaches more hosts — but it means the fix is to correct the plan (which hands it a fresh
budget), not to wait.

## Host locks

The operator applies at most one playbook to a given host at a time, across the whole cluster. Before
a run starts it takes a short-lived lock — a Kubernetes `Lease` in the operator's namespace — on every
host the run targets, and releases them when the run finishes. Locks are keyed by host and shared by
every plan, so two plans that target the same Node cannot run against it at once, even when they live
in different namespaces.

Acquisition is all-or-nothing: a run starts only once it holds the lock for **every** host it targets.
If another run holds any of them, the plan waits and retries rather than running against part of its
inventory. Plans whose hosts overlap therefore take turns — one run finishes and releases its locks,
then the next acquires them. Plans over completely separate hosts never block each other.

While a plan is waiting on a lock held by another run, its
[`Blocked` condition](./results-and-troubleshooting.md#conditions) is `True`, its `.status` names the
host and the run holding it, and the operator logs a warning. The plan is `Applying` because its
recorded run is active. The `Running` condition is set to `True` in the same reconcile that creates the
run's Job (a run adopted during recovery picks it up on the next tick), and re-asserted on every tick
that observes it unfinished. A plan waiting on the lock has no Job yet, so it remains without
`Running=True` until the lock is free. Being blocked is a temporary wait, not a failure, and the run
proceeds on its own as soon as the lock is free.

A crashed operator's locks expire on their own after a short period, so a host is never left locked
indefinitely.

## Cleaning up finished Jobs

`spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished` controls how long a finished run's Job and its pod linger before
Kubernetes' TTL controller reaps them (values below 60 seconds are raised to 60). Set it higher if
you want more time to inspect a finished pod, lower to reclaim resources sooner. The recap the
operator needs is captured from the pod's termination message at completion, so reaping the pod does
not lose your `.status` results.
