# Scheduling and execution modes

Two independent things decide *when* a plan runs and *what* runs:

- the **schedule** (and time zone) decides at which wall-clock times a run may fire;
- the **execution mode** plus **drift detection** decide which hosts actually execute when a run does
  fire.

## Schedule

`spec.schedule` is a standard **5-field cron** expression (`minute hour day-of-month month
day-of-week`). `spec.timeZone` is the IANA time zone it is evaluated in; if omitted, **UTC** is used.
A run fires inside a short time window around each scheduled tick, so an exact match to the second is
not required, but the granularity is minutes, not seconds.

```yaml
spec:
  schedule: "0 3 * * *"      # 03:00 every day
  timeZone: Europe/Berlin    # ...in Berlin local time (honours DST)
```

**Omitting `schedule`** means "eligible to run as soon as possible", not "never": the plan is not
gated on a clock and runs when its hosts are out of date. Use an explicit schedule when you want runs
pinned to a maintenance window.

The plan's `.status.nextRun` shows the next computed fire time, and the `Next run` printer column
surfaces it in `kubectl get playbookplan`.

## Suspending a plan

Set `spec.suspend: true` to stop the operator starting new runs, the same idea as a CronJob's
`.spec.suspend`. It is a pause switch, not a delete:

- A run **already in progress** is left to finish — suspending never kills a running Job.
- No **new** run is started while suspended, in any mode: a `Recurring` plan skips its schedule
  ticks, and a `OneShot` plan holds off even when hosts are out of date.
- The `Suspended` printer column reads `true` and `.status.nextRun` is cleared — there is no next run
  while paused. The plan's phase keeps showing its underlying state (e.g. `Scheduled` or
  `Succeeded`); the column, not the phase, is what tells you it is paused.

Clear the flag (`spec.suspend: false`, or remove it) to resume; a `Recurring` plan picks up again at
its next scheduled tick. Suspending does not pause drift detection — editing the playbook or a
referenced Secret while suspended still updates the current hash, so the run that eventually resumes
reflects the latest inputs.

## Execution modes

`spec.mode` is one of:

### `OneShot` (default)

Converge to a goal state and then stop. Only **out-of-date** hosts run; once every host has succeeded
on the current playbook and inputs, the plan settles into `Succeeded` (or `Failed` if some host could
not be brought current) and stops — it does **not** keep re-running on the schedule. It wakes again
only when the inputs change (see drift detection below). Good for "make it so": apply a configuration
or a one-time migration and confirm every host got it.

### `Recurring`

Re-apply on **every** schedule tick. *All* hosts run each time, regardless of whether they ran
successfully last time, and the plan reschedules itself back to `Scheduled` for the next tick. Good
for periodic enforcement or inherently repeating work: nightly package upgrades, drift correction,
health tasks. A `Recurring` plan needs a `schedule`.

## Drift detection

To decide which hosts are out of date, the operator computes an **execution hash** over the playbook
text **plus the contents of every referenced Secret** (variables and files). The hash is
order-insensitive, so reordering inputs does not count as a change, and it excludes the internally
rendered workspace, whose content (e.g. proxy pod IPs) legitimately changes every run.

- Each host records the hash it **last succeeded on** (`.status.hostsStatus.<host>.lastAppliedHash`).
- A host whose last-applied hash equals the current hash is **current** and is skipped (in
  `OneShot`).
- When you edit the playbook, or change a referenced variables/files Secret, the hash changes: the
  plan resets to `Pending`, clears its retry bookkeeping, and every host becomes out of date again.

This is what makes `OneShot` idempotent and cheap: editing an unrelated field does not re-run
everything, but a real change to the playbook or its inputs does. The current hash is visible as
`.status.currentHash` and in the `Current hash` printer column.

## Retries and adoption

Within a single hash, if a run's Job needs to be retried the operator numbers successive Jobs
(`apply-<plan>-<id>-<n>`) rather than colliding on one name — the playbook and inputs are unchanged,
so the hash alone cannot distinguish attempts. You generally do not interact with this; it is why you
may see more than one Job object for the same run.

## Cleaning up finished Jobs

`spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished` controls how long a finished run's Job and its pod linger before
Kubernetes' TTL controller reaps them (values below 60 seconds are raised to 60). Set it higher if
you want more time to inspect a finished pod, lower to reclaim resources sooner. The recap the
operator needs is captured from the pod's termination message at completion, so reaping the pod does
not lose your `.status` results.
