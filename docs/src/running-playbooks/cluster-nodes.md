# Targeting cluster nodes

A `ClusterInventory` builds host groups **from your cluster's own Nodes**, matched by Node labels,
and reaches them over *managed SSH* — the operator's agentless, node-root access path. Use it to run
playbooks against the machines your cluster runs on: OS patching, kernel and k3s upgrades,
node-level configuration, and the like.

> **Managed SSH is node-root.** A managed-SSH session is `root` on the target Node, which is why
> access to it is gated. Which Nodes your namespace may reach is capped by a cluster-admin-authored
> `NodeAccessPolicy`; if a `ClusterInventory` resolves to **zero** hosts even though Nodes match your
> selector, no policy grants your namespace those Nodes. See
> [Node access policies](../cluster-operators/node-access-policies.md).

## Defining host groups

Each entry under `spec.hosts` is a group: a `name` plus a Node **label selector**. A Node that
matches lands in that group, and the group name becomes an Ansible group your playbook can target. A
group may use either selector form, following Kubernetes' label-selector semantics:

- **`matchLabels`** — an exact-match map; a Node must carry every listed label and value.
- **`matchExpressions`** — a list of `{ key, operator, values }` terms with operators `In`, `NotIn`,
  `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`.

```yaml
apiVersion: ansible.cloudbending.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterInventory
metadata:
  name: cluster-nodes
spec:
  hosts:
    - name: controlplanes
      matchLabels:
        kubernetes.io/os: linux
        node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: "true"
    - name: workers
      matchExpressions:
        - { key: kubernetes.io/os, operator: In, values: [linux] }
        - { key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane, operator: DoesNotExist }
```

The controller watches Nodes and keeps `.status.resolvedHosts` and `.status.hostCount` up to date as
Nodes are labelled, added, or removed, so `kubectl get clusterinventory` shows how many Nodes
currently match.

## Group variables

Each group may carry a `variables` map, rendered as Ansible **group vars** for every Node the group
resolves to. Use it to pin node facts the playbook author should not need to know — most often
`ansible_python_interpreter`, so playbooks don't emit interpreter-discovery warnings:

```yaml
spec:
  hosts:
    - name: controlplanes
      matchLabels:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: "true"
      variables:
        ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
```

Group variables are part of a plan's execution hash, so changing one re-applies the playbook to the
affected Nodes on the next run. The connection variables the operator manages itself — `ansible_host`,
`ansible_port`, `ansible_user`, and the `ansible_ssh_*` options — are rejected: they are wired from
managed SSH, and a plan that references an inventory setting one does not run until you remove it.

## Tolerations

To reach a tainted Node such as a control-plane node, the managed-SSH proxy pod for that Node must
tolerate its taints. Set `spec.tolerations` on the `ClusterInventory`; they are applied to the proxy
pods this inventory creates. `tolerations: [{ operator: Exists }]` tolerates everything, which is
safe here because each proxy pod is pinned to one exact Node, so tolerating all taints only lets it
schedule onto *that* Node.

```yaml
spec:
  tolerations:
    - operator: Exists
```

The `not-ready` and `unreachable` taints Kubernetes applies to a `NotReady` Node are tolerated
automatically — you do not need to list them. See [NotReady nodes](#notready-nodes).

## How managed SSH reaches a Node

You do not configure any of this; it is background for the security model and for troubleshooting.
For each targeted Node in a run, the operator:

1. Schedules a short-lived **proxy pod** onto that exact Node. The pod runs a real `sshd` and is
   granted just enough privilege (`hostPID`, a host `/proc` mount, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` +
   `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`) that each SSH session can `nsenter` into the Node's host namespaces, making the
   session `root` on the Node. The pod does not use `privileged: true`, `hostNetwork`, or `hostIPC`.
2. Mints a fresh SSH **host certificate** for that run from the operator's in-memory certificate
   authority, and a matching **client certificate** for the Job. Certificates are per-run and
   short-lived; a run can authenticate only to *its own* proxy pods.
3. Locks each proxy pod's ingress to that run's Job with a NetworkPolicy.
4. Renders the inventory so Ansible dials the proxy pod and verifies the Node's host certificate.
5. Tears the proxy pods, per-run Secrets, and NetworkPolicy down when the run finishes.

There is **no standing agent or DaemonSet** on your Nodes: proxy pods exist only for the duration of
a run. The security properties of this path — per-run certificate isolation, the in-memory CA, and
why `NodeAccessPolicy` is mandatory — are covered in
[Security model](../cluster-operators/security.md).

## NotReady nodes

A Node matched by a `ClusterInventory` stays in the inventory even when it is `NotReady`. The operator
still schedules the proxy pod onto it and waits for the pod to become Ready. While it waits, the
`PlaybookPlan` carries a `WaitingForNodes` condition naming the pending Node(s).

If the proxy pod does not become Ready within the wait window, the run proceeds without that Node:
Ansible reports it **unreachable** for the run, and the Node is retried on the next run, so it heals on
its own once it recovers. The wait window is set by the cluster operator and shrinks the longer a Node
has been unreachable (see [Deployment](../cluster-operators/deployment.md)).

## Requirements and limitations

- The operator must be installed and your namespace **enrolled** (see
  [Deployment](../cluster-operators/deployment.md)).
- A `NodeAccessPolicy` must grant your namespace the Nodes you want to reach, or the inventory
  resolves to nothing for you.
- The proxy image must be a real OpenSSH `sshd` image the cluster can pull. This is an operator
  concern; the default and how to pin it are covered under
  [Deployment](../cluster-operators/deployment.md).
- Managed SSH targets **Linux** Nodes.

## When to use a StaticInventory instead

`ClusterInventory` is only for machines that are **Kubernetes Nodes of this cluster**. To reach
anything else — external servers, appliances, network gear, or nodes of a *different* cluster — use a
`StaticInventory` with your own SSH key. See [Targeting external hosts](./external-hosts.md).
