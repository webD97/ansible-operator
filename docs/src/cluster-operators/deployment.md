# Deployment

The operator ships as a Helm chart under `chart/`. This page covers installing it, the namespace and
Pod-Security requirements it imposes, the managed-SSH proxy image, and the two fail-closed knobs —
namespace enrollment and node access — you have to open deliberately.

## Install

Install into its **own dedicated namespace**:

```sh
helm install --create-namespace -n ansible-system ansible-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/webd97/charts/ansible-operator \
  --version <version>
```

For development from a checkout, replace the OCI URL and version with `./chart`.

Do **not** create `PlaybookPlan`s or inventories in the operator's own namespace — those belong in
tenant namespaces. The operator namespace is where its runtime machinery lives: per-run Leases and
the managed-SSH proxy pods, Secrets, and NetworkPolicies. (The admin-authored `NodeAccessPolicy`
objects are cluster-scoped and live in no namespace.) Keeping it separate means only this one
namespace needs the privileged-pod exception below.

### If the operator crash-loops on startup

Some conditions are refused loudly at startup rather than worked around, because an operator that
runs without them makes decisions on data it does not have. `kubectl logs` names the one that
applies:

- **it cannot list Nodes.** The `PlaybookPlan` controller waits for its Node cache before it
  reconciles anything, and gives up after two minutes. Node readiness is what decides whether a
  `OneShot` run is worth starting at all ([NotReady nodes](../running-playbooks/cluster-nodes.md#notready-nodes)),
  and an empty cache reports every Node as `Ready` — so starting anyway would launch exactly the
  runs a waiting plan exists to hold back. Check that the operator's `ClusterRole` still grants
  `list`/`watch` on `nodes` and that the API server is reachable. A cause that clears itself — RBAC
  arriving after the Deployment, an API server rolling — is picked up by the next restart with no
  action needed.
- **`managedSsh.proxyImage` is unset.** There is deliberately no default for this node-root image;
  see [The managed-SSH proxy image](#the-managed-ssh-proxy-image).

### If the operator stops being able to watch Nodes later

The same loss of access *after* startup does not crash the operator, and does not stop it either —
which is why it is worth knowing about. The Node cache keeps serving whatever it last saw, so the
operator carries on making readiness decisions from a snapshot: a Node that goes down from then on
still reads `Ready`, so a `OneShot` run starts against it and spends the full proxy wait discovering
otherwise, and a plan already
[held](../running-playbooks/cluster-nodes.md#holding-instead-of-starting) for a Node is not released
when that Node comes back until its hourly re-check. Nothing else misbehaves, and everything
recovers on its own the moment the watch does.

It is not silent. After a handful of consecutive failures the operator logs a line saying the Node
cache has stopped updating and what that costs, rather than repeating a bare watch error. It repeats
that line every five minutes for as long as the watch stays broken, and logs `Node watch recovered`
once the cache is being updated again:

```sh
kubectl -n ansible-system logs deploy/<release> | grep -E 'Node watch (has failed|recovered)'
```

The causes are the startup ones: a `ClusterRole` that lost its `list`/`watch` on `nodes` in an
upgrade, or an API server the operator can no longer reach. Restoring either is enough — there is
nothing to restart.

## Pod Security Admission

Managed-SSH proxy pods (created dynamically by the operator at runtime, not by the chart) run with
`hostPID: true` and added `SYS_ADMIN`/`SYS_PTRACE` capabilities so each SSH session can `nsenter` into
the target Node's namespaces. That combination is only permitted under the **`privileged`** Pod
Security Standard, so the operator's namespace must carry the label:

```sh
kubectl label namespace ansible-system pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged
```

The proxy pods do not use `privileged: true`, `hostNetwork`, or `hostIPC` — only `hostPID` plus the
two capabilities. Because this exception is scoped to the single operator namespace, tenant
namespaces need no Pod-Security relaxation.

## SELinux-enforcing nodes

On SELinux-enforcing Nodes the proxy pods additionally set
`securityContext.seLinuxOptions.type: spc_t` ("super-privileged container"), the label that lets the
`nsenter`'d process touch the host filesystem. This is applied automatically, is a no-op on
non-SELinux nodes, and needs no action from you.

## The managed-SSH proxy image

Cluster-node access needs a **real OpenSSH `sshd`** image for the proxy pods; the operator's own image
is distroless and cannot serve this role. It is configured via the chart's `managedSsh.proxyImage`.

The default is the first-party, minimal, statically-linked `sshd` image published alongside the
operator (`ghcr.io/webd97/ansible-operator-sshd`), pinned to a release-specific `@sha256:` digest.
The empty `tag` is intentional: the release workflow repins the digest when publishing a new proxy
image.

**This is a node-root pod, so treat the image as node-root supply chain.** If you override the default,
pin the image to a digest from a registry you trust — set `tag: ""` and put the digest in `repository`:

```yaml
# values.yaml
managedSsh:
  proxyImage:
    repository: my-registry.example.com/ansible-operator-sshd@sha256:<digest>
    tag: ""
```

The value is rendered into the operator's config and consumed at pod-build time; changing it rolls
the operator (via a `checksum/config` annotation) rather than hot-reloading.

## NotReady nodes

When a `ClusterInventory` targets a `NotReady` Node, the operator still schedules its proxy pod and
waits for the pod to become Ready. If it does not become Ready in time, the run proceeds without that
Node — Ansible reports it unreachable, and it is retried on the next run. The same bound applies to
an old-credential pod still terminating after a reset; it is never reused. A pod that has reached
`Running` normally is waited on until Ready as usual.

The wait scales with how long the Node has been silent (its last `Ready` heartbeat): a Node that only
just went `NotReady` is given the full wait, one silent for longer is given up on sooner. Tune it via
`managedSsh.readiness`:

```yaml
# values.yaml
managedSsh:
  readiness:
    graceSeconds: 600         # full wait for a node whose last heartbeat is within thresholdDays[0]
    aggressiveness: 2         # divide the wait at each further threshold
    thresholdDays: [3, 7, 30] # heartbeat-age boundaries; past the last one the node is given up at once
```

The defaults wait 600 / 300 / 150 / 0 seconds for a Node last seen within 3 / 7 / 30 / more days.
Like the other config values, a change rolls the operator rather than hot-reloading.

## Enrolled namespaces

The operator's cluster-wide RBAC does **not** include `secrets`, `jobs`, or `pods`. Those verbs are
granted per-namespace, only for **enrolled** namespaces, via a `Role`/`RoleBinding` the chart renders.
The enrolled set is the operator's own namespace plus the chart's `watchNamespaces`:

```yaml
# values.yaml
watchNamespaces:
  - team-a
  - team-b
```

A `PlaybookPlan` created in a namespace that is **not** enrolled is refused with
`status.phase = UnauthorizedNamespace`, before any Secret is read or Job created. There is no "all
namespaces" option: this allowlist bounds an operator compromise to the enrolled namespaces rather
than the whole cluster.

Two consequences to plan for:

- **Enrolling is an admin action that requires a restart.** The config is read once at startup;
  editing `watchNamespaces` and running `helm upgrade` rolls the operator so it re-reads the set. It
  is not hot-reloaded. (The same is true of `managedSsh.proxyImage`.)
- **The operator can read *and delete* Secrets in every enrolled namespace.** Enroll only namespaces
  **dedicated to Ansible ops**, not general-purpose application namespaces, so this power covers as
  few unrelated Secrets as possible. See
  [Security model → the blast radius you accept](./security.md#blast-radius).
- **Un-enrol a namespace only while its plans are idle.** A plan with a run in flight carries the
  `ansible.cloudbending.dev/run-cleanup` finalizer, and the `patch` permission that lets the operator
  remove it again is granted per enrolled namespace. Removing the namespace from `watchNamespaces`
  while a run is active therefore leaves any plan deleted afterwards stuck in `Terminating`: the
  operator can no longer release the run *or* drop its own finalizer. Recovering means re-enrolling
  the namespace (the operator then finishes the teardown on its own), or removing the finalizer by
  hand and cleaning the run up with the
  [manual procedure](../running-playbooks/results-and-troubleshooting.md#the-plan-is-stuck-in-applying).
  Check for active runs before un-enrolling:

  ```sh
  kubectl get playbookplan -n <namespace> \
    -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,PHASE:.status.phase,RUN:.status.activeRun.jobName
  ```

Under the hood this is driven by a small TOML config (`watch_namespaces`, `proxy_image`) that the
chart renders into a mounted ConfigMap. For local development you can point the binary at a config
file directly with `run --config <path>` and set `POD_NAMESPACE` (the operator's own namespace, always
enrolled).

### Protect operator-created Jobs

The chart's `Role` grants the operator ServiceAccount permission to create and delete Jobs in each
enrolled namespace, and to patch `PlaybookPlan` objects there. Kubernetes RBAC is additive: this does
**not** stop another `Role`, `ClusterRole`, or binding from granting the same permissions to a user
or another ServiceAccount. Keep enrolled namespaces dedicated to Ansible operations and do not grant
untrusted principals `create` on `batch/jobs` there.

Two of those grants are wider than what the operator does with them, because RBAC cannot express the
narrower rule:

- **`delete` on `batch/jobs`** cancels the run of a plan that is deleted mid-run, or whose `Play` record
  is removed, rather than leaving its pod to the deleting client's propagation policy. The operator
  deletes only a Job whose identity it has validated, and passes that Job's UID as a delete
  precondition, but the grant itself covers every Job in the namespace.
- **`patch` on `playbookplans`** carries the `ansible.cloudbending.dev/run-cleanup` finalizer, which
  is what keeps a deleted plan alive until its node-root proxy pods and host Leases are released.
  RBAC cannot restrict a patch to `metadata.finalizers`, so the grant permits writing the spec and
  metadata of any plan in the namespace. It is deliberately not in the `ClusterRole` — the operator
  reads plans cluster-wide but can only write them where it is already trusted to run them.

Both are accounted for in the operator privilege summary in the repository's `THREAT_MODEL.md`.
Neither widens what a compromised operator can reach: it already creates node-root proxy pods for
runs in those namespaces.

This matters for more than ordinary workload separation. The operator records a run before creating
its Job and later checks the Job's owner reference and run labels to identify it. A principal that can
create Jobs in an enrolled namespace can occupy an expected Job name, or copy the operator's identity
metadata onto a different pod template. The reconciler refuses an ordinary foreign Job and waits for
it, but object metadata alone cannot prove which principal created a Job that carries all the expected
fields.

Check the effective permission for the operator and for every other principal that may act in an
enrolled namespace. Replace the ServiceAccount names with the ones used by your installation:

```sh
ENROLLED_NAMESPACE=team-a
OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=ansible-system
OPERATOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=ansible-operator

OPERATOR="system:serviceaccount:$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE:$OPERATOR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
TENANT="system:serviceaccount:$ENROLLED_NAMESPACE:default"

# expected: yes for all three
kubectl auth can-i create jobs -n "$ENROLLED_NAMESPACE" --as="$OPERATOR"
kubectl auth can-i delete jobs -n "$ENROLLED_NAMESPACE" --as="$OPERATOR"
kubectl auth can-i patch playbookplans.ansible.cloudbending.dev \
  -n "$ENROLLED_NAMESPACE" --as="$OPERATOR"

# expected for an untrusted tenant ServiceAccount: no for all three
kubectl auth can-i create jobs -n "$ENROLLED_NAMESPACE" --as="$TENANT"
kubectl auth can-i delete jobs -n "$ENROLLED_NAMESPACE" --as="$TENANT"
kubectl auth can-i patch playbookplans.ansible.cloudbending.dev \
  -n "$ENROLLED_NAMESPACE" --as="$TENANT"
```

A `yes` in the second block means some other binding hands a tenant principal the same authority the
operator relies on: Job creation lets it occupy a run's expected Job name, Job deletion lets it
cancel runs, and plan patching lets it strip the run-cleanup finalizer and strand a deleted plan's
proxy pods and host Leases.

Review namespaced `RoleBinding`s and cluster-wide `ClusterRoleBinding`s as well; a cluster-wide grant
can bypass the namespace's intended local policy. If an enrolled namespace must also host unrelated
Job workloads, use an admission policy to reserve the operator's Job identity instead: allow only the
operator ServiceAccount to create Jobs with the operator's reserved component/plan/run labels and
with names matching the operator's `apply-...` convention. Do not solve this by allowing every Job in
the namespace to bypass admission.

See [Security model → the Job trust boundary](./security.md#the-job-trust-boundary) for why this
restriction is required even though the operator validates Job identity during recovery.

## ServiceAccount tokens

The operator ServiceAccount disables implicit token mounting, while the operator Deployment
explicitly requests the token it needs for Kubernetes API access. Managed-SSH proxy pods do not
mount a ServiceAccount token. An Ansible Job receives a token only when its `PlaybookPlan` sets
`serviceAccountName`.

## Workload security contexts

The chart sets `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` on the operator container. Managed-SSH proxy
containers cannot use that setting because Kubernetes treats their required `SYS_ADMIN` capability
as privilege escalation. The proxy receives only the capabilities and SELinux type required for
node access. Admission policies should scope any required exception to pods labelled
`ansible.cloudbending.dev/component=managed-ssh-proxy` instead of excluding the whole namespace. The
full list of exceptions to configure is [Admission policies](./admission-policies.md).

Generated Ansible Jobs use the optional `securityContext` from their `PlaybookPlan`. Keeping this
next to the plan's image allows each execution image to declare compatible settings while admission
policies enforce the cluster's required baseline.

## Network policies

The per-run managed-SSH ingress policy is created when a run uses managed SSH. Optional egress
NetworkPolicies can be enabled for the operator Deployment, Ansible Jobs, and managed-SSH proxy pods.
They are disabled by default so an upgrade never changes or broadens existing network controls.

These values are raw NetworkPolicy egress rule arrays, so they follow NetworkPolicy semantics rather
than Helm's: `[{}]` — the shipped operator and playbook default — means "policy present, egress
unrestricted", while `[]` means a policy with no rules at all, which **denies all egress**. The
managed-SSH default is `[]` because the proxy only needs inbound SSH. Do not use `[]` for the operator
or playbook unless deliberately blocking the API server, DNS, and their other outbound connections.
Configure the rule arrays before enabling them:

```yaml
networkPolicy:
  enabled: true
  operator:
    egress:
      - to:
          - ipBlock:
              cidr: 10.0.0.1/32
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 6443
  playbook:
    egress: [{}] # Narrow this to DNS, package sources, direct SSH and other destinations used by playbooks.
  managedSsh:
    egress: [] # The proxy only needs inbound SSH; commands run after nsenter use the node network namespace.
```

When managed SSH is used, the operator adds the narrow Ansible-Job-to-proxy TCP/22 rule to the
playbook egress policy. API server and DNS addresses vary across clusters and CNIs, so the chart
cannot derive portable restrictive defaults.

## Custom Resource Definitions

The chart bundles the five CRDs (`PlaybookPlan`, `Play`, `ClusterInventory`, `StaticInventory`,
`NodeAccessPolicy`) in a built-in `crds` subchart. `crds.install` defaults to `true` because the
operator requires these definitions. They are normal Helm templates, so Helm upgrades reconcile
CRD changes together with the operator chart:

```yaml
crds:
  install: true
```

Set `crds.install: false` only when another release owns the same cluster-scoped CRDs. The
manifests are generated from the operator binary itself (`ansible-operator crds`) and stored under
the subchart's `templates/` directory.
The regeneration procedure lives in `chart/README.md`.

### Schema changes are part of an upgrade

A release using `crds.install: false` owns this step itself: apply the definitions shipped with the
new chart version *before* the operator that expects them. A field or a selector operator a plan
author writes is rejected by the API server while an older schema is installed, and the rejection
names the CRD rather than the chart, so it reads like an authoring mistake.

A schema can also become **stricter**, and one has: a `ClusterInventory`'s `spec.hosts[]` entries no
longer accept unknown fields. Until that change the API server kept whatever was written there and
the operator ignored it, so a misspelt `matchExpresions` applied cleanly and left the group matching
**every** Node in the cluster. It is now pruned with a warning, and `kubectl apply` rejects it by
default. Anything that has been silently carrying such a field — a manifest in Git, a chart of your
own — therefore starts failing to apply after this upgrade, on an object nobody edited. That is the
point of the change, but it is worth knowing before the pipeline tells you: the fix is to correct the
field name, and the group it belongs to was never selecting what it claimed to.

The chart declares `kubeVersion: ">=1.25.0-0"` because two CRDs use **CRD validation rules**
(`x-kubernetes-validations`):

- The `Play` CRD freezes a run record's spec for its lifetime, one of the controls that keeps a
  committed run from being steered by anyone with write access to `plays` (see
  [Security](./security.md) and `T-ESC-8`).
- The `PlaybookPlan` CRD caps a plan's name at 63 characters, because that name is written as a
  label value onto every object a run creates.

Kubernetes only evaluates such rules from 1.25 onwards, and an older or non-conformant API server
would **ignore them silently** rather than reject them — so if you bypass the version constraint,
confirm they are actually in force rather than assuming it. The operator re-checks the plan-name cap
itself and refuses an over-long plan with a clear message on the resource, so only the `Play` rule
depends on the API server alone.

Being ordinary release resources also means Helm would delete them on `helm uninstall`, and
deleting a CRD deletes every custom resource of that kind cluster-wide. `crds.keep` defaults to
`true` and annotates the definitions with `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so uninstalling the
chart leaves both the definitions and your `PlaybookPlan`s in place; set it to `false` if you
would rather have an uninstall clean everything up.

## Node labels for plan dependencies

A `PlaybookPlan` that sets `spec.provides` publishes what it has finished onto the Nodes it
converged, as a label `<namespace>.plan.ansible.cloudbending.dev/<plan-name>` carrying the declared
version. Another plan's `ClusterInventory` selects on that label, so its runs only ever reach hosts
the first plan is done with; ordinary workloads can use the same label in `nodeAffinity`.

This needs `patch` on Nodes, which is **cluster-wide** — RBAC cannot narrow a verb to one field, so
the same grant would permit editing taints, `spec.unschedulable` or any other label. The chart
therefore ships the permission with a guard, and both halves are values you control:

```yaml
# values.yaml
nodeLabels:
  enabled: true          # grants nodes: patch and turns the feature on
  admissionPolicy: true  # holds that grant to the operator's own label keys
```

`nodeLabels.admissionPolicy` renders a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` and binding that allow the
operator's ServiceAccount to add, change and remove only keys containing
`.plan.ansible.cloudbending.dev/`, and require everything else about the Node — spec, annotations,
every other label — to be unchanged. It is scoped to that ServiceAccount, so it never gets in the
way of an administrator editing a Node, including cleaning these labels up by hand.

**On Kubernetes below 1.30** the policy API is not generally available, and the install fails with
`no matches for kind "ValidatingAdmissionPolicy" in version "admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1"`. Set
`nodeLabels.admissionPolicy=false`: the feature keeps working and the `patch` grant is simply
unguarded. The chart does not detect this for you on purpose — `helm template` without
`--api-versions` reports the API as missing, so a capability check would quietly drop the guard
while keeping the permission, and a security control that disappears without a word is worse than
one you turned off knowingly.

**Labels left behind** — by a plan deleted while the operator was down, or by uninstalling the
operator — are swept whenever the operator's plan cache completes a full listing: at startup, and
again after any watch reconnection. A label is removed only when the plan named in its key no longer
exists; a plan that still exists but has stopped providing is handled by its own reconcile.

**To keep the operator off Node objects entirely**, set `nodeLabels.enabled=false`. Plans with
`spec.provides` still run; they report in their status that node labels are disabled on this
cluster, so a plan waiting on one of them says why instead of waiting silently. Note that this also
removes the permission to *remove* labels already written: the sweep above still runs, but it can
only report what it found — a warning naming the orphaned labels — and you remove them with
`kubectl label nodes -l '<key>' '<key>-'`, where `<key>` is
`<namespace>.plan.ansible.cloudbending.dev/<plan-name>`. A plan that still exists is not in that
warning; its `ProvidesLabels` condition counts the Nodes still carrying its label.

Watch for that warning after turning the feature off: until those labels are gone, plans selecting
on them still treat those Nodes as ready.

See [Playbook plans](../running-playbooks/playbook-plans.md) for authoring `spec.provides`, and
[Cluster nodes](../running-playbooks/cluster-nodes.md) for selecting on the labels.

## Grant node access

Installing the operator and enrolling a namespace is **not** enough for cluster-node playbooks: node
access is itself fail-closed. Until you author a `NodeAccessPolicy`, every namespace resolves to
**zero** Nodes and managed-SSH plans target nothing. Continue at
[Node access policies](./node-access-policies.md).
