# ansible-operator Helm chart

## Install

Install a released chart from GHCR:

```sh
helm install --create-namespace -n ansible-system ansible-operator \
  oci://ghcr.io/webd97/charts/ansible-operator \
  --version <version>
```

For development from a checkout:

```sh
helm install --create-namespace -n ansible-system ansible-operator ./chart
```

The operator must be installed into its own dedicated namespace — see the comment above
`serviceAccount` in `values.yaml` for why. Don't create PlaybookPlans/ClusterInventories/
StaticInventories in that same namespace; those belong in your own tenant namespaces.

Optional egress NetworkPolicies are configurable through `networkPolicy` in `values.yaml`. Operator
and playbook policies default to `[{}]` ("policy present, egress unrestricted"); the managed-SSH
proxy policy defaults to an empty array (`[]`), NetworkPolicy's deny-all-egress, because the proxy
only needs inbound SSH. Do not use `[]` for the operator or playbook unless deliberately blocking
their outbound connections.

### Node labels

`nodeLabels.enabled` (default `true`) grants the operator `patch` on Nodes, which is what lets a
`PlaybookPlan` with `spec.provides` publish `<namespace>.plan.ansible.cloudbending.dev/<plan-name>`
onto the Nodes it converged, for other plans to depend on. `nodeLabels.admissionPolicy` (default
`true`) renders a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` that holds that grant to exactly those keys.

`ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` is generally available from Kubernetes **1.30**, while this chart's
`kubeVersion` allows 1.25. On an older cluster the install fails with `no matches for kind
"ValidatingAdmissionPolicy"`; set `nodeLabels.admissionPolicy=false` to keep the feature with an
unguarded permission, or `nodeLabels.enabled=false` to give up the feature and the permission
together. There is deliberately no capability auto-detection — see the comments in `values.yaml`.

The policy applies to the ServiceAccount the operator runs as. With `serviceAccount.create=false`,
set `serviceAccount.name` too: otherwise that is the namespace's `default` ServiceAccount, and every
other workload using it in the release namespace is held to the operator's label bound.

### Pod Security Admission

Managed-ssh proxy pods (created dynamically by the operator at runtime, not by this chart) run
with added `SYS_ADMIN`/`SYS_PTRACE` capabilities so each SSH session can `nsenter` into the
target node's real mount/net/ipc/uts namespaces — they deliberately do *not* use
`hostIPC`/`hostNetwork`/`privileged: true` (see `managed_ssh.rs`'s module docs for why). They
*do* use `hostPID: true`, unlike the other three host-namespace flags: `setns(CLONE_NEWPID)` can
only move to a descendant PID namespace, never an ancestor like the host's, so per-session
`nsenter --pid` is fundamentally impossible from a pod whose own PID namespace isn't already the
host's — there's no capability-scoped workaround for this one. `SYS_ADMIN`/`hostPID` still aren't
permitted under the `restricted` or `baseline` Pod Security Standards, only `privileged`, so the
operator's namespace needs that label, e.g.:

```sh
kubectl label namespace ansible-system pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged
```

### SELinux-enforcing nodes

Proxy pods also set `securityContext.seLinuxOptions.type: spc_t` ("super-privileged
container"). Joining the host's mount namespace via nsenter does not change a process's own
SELinux label — it stays whatever the container runtime assigned (typically `container_t`),
which is denied write access to almost all host filesystem paths regardless of Unix
permissions or capabilities. `spc_t` is the same label `privileged: true` pods and
node-debugging tools (e.g. `oc debug node/...`) get, and is what actually allows nsenter'd
processes to touch the host filesystem. This is a no-op on non-SELinux nodes.

## Custom resource definitions

The chart contains a built-in `crds` subchart. Its `crds.install` value defaults to `true` because
the operator cannot work without these definitions. Unlike files in Helm's special `crds/`
directory, these manifests are normal subchart templates and are reconciled on chart upgrades.

Disable them only when another release manages the same cluster-scoped CRDs:

```yaml
crds:
  install: false
```

Because these are release resources rather than files in Helm's `crds/` directory, they would be
deleted by `helm uninstall` — and deleting a CRD deletes every custom resource of that kind in the
cluster. `crds.keep` therefore defaults to `true`, which annotates them with
`helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so an uninstall leaves the definitions and your resources behind
(delete them by hand if you really want them gone):

```yaml
crds:
  keep: false
```

The `crds` subchart is built into this chart and is not published separately.

After changing any `#[derive(CustomResource)]` type in the Rust source, regenerate them:

```sh
just generate-crds
```
