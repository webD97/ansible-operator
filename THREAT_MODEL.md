## 1. What this system does (and why it is dangerous)

`ansible-operator` runs Ansible playbooks against **cluster nodes** (and arbitrary
external hosts) from inside Kubernetes. A `PlaybookPlan` fans out to one Kubernetes
`Job` per run; for `ClusterInventory`-sourced hosts, the Job connects over SSH to an
ephemeral **managed-ssh proxy pod** the operator schedules onto the target node.

The proxy pod is, by design, a **node-root primitive**:

- `hostPID: true` ([`managed_ssh.rs` `build_pod`](src/v1beta1/controllers/playbookplancontroller/managed_ssh.rs))
- `/proc` bind-mounted from the host (`HostPathVolumeSource` → `/host/proc`)
- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` + `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, plus SELinux `spc_t` (the label `oc debug node/…`
  and `privileged: true` pods get)
- every SSH session is wrapped in `nsenter -m/-n/-i/-u` into the host's mount / net /
  ipc / uts namespaces via `/host/proc/1/ns/*`, then `exec sh -c "$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND"`

**Consequence:** anyone who can open an authenticated SSH session to a proxy pod gets a
root shell in the host's namespaces — full control of that node. The entire security
posture of this operator reduces to *who can reach a proxy pod, on which node, with a
valid certificate.* Everything below exists to constrain that.

The operator is therefore a **cluster-privileged component**: compromise of the
operator, its service account, or its CA is equivalent to root on every node it can
schedule onto, plus read/write access to Secrets in its **enrolled** namespaces
(the operator ns ∪ `watchNamespaces` — not the whole cluster; see §8, RBAC).

## 2. Assets

| # | Asset | Why it matters |
|---|-------|----------------|
| A1 | **Root on cluster nodes** (via proxy pods) | The ultimate target. Node-root ⇒ container escape, kubelet credential theft, cluster takeover. |
| A2 | **The operator's SSH CA private key** (in-memory only, held in the operator process) | Signs *both* host and client certs. Whoever holds it can mint a client cert with principal `root` and SSH into any proxy pod → A1. Never persisted to the cluster; an operator restart rotates it. No in-process rotation or revocation. |
| A3 | **Per-run client-cert Secret** (`managed-ssh-client-<run-id>`, plan ns) | A live credential trusted by every proxy pod of that run. Created in the plan namespace so the Job pod can mount it (pods only mount same-namespace Secrets); owner-referenced to the PlaybookPlan and deleted by name at run completion. |
| A4 | **NodeAccessPolicy resources** (cluster-scoped) | The admin-authored ceiling that decides which namespace may target which nodes. Cluster-scoped, so authoring one needs cluster RBAC. Tampering = privilege escalation to more nodes. |
| A5 | **Tenant Secrets** referenced by PlaybookPlans (vars, files, StaticInventory SSH keys) | Contain credentials the playbook uses; the operator can read Secrets in its enrolled namespaces (operator ns ∪ `watchNamespaces`), not cluster-wide. |
| A6 | **Playbook content & execution integrity** | The playbook runs as root on nodes. Tampering with it = arbitrary node code execution. |
| A7 | **Cluster control plane / node kubelet identities** | Reachable *from* a rooted node (A1); the blast radius of A1. |

**Trust boundary crossings that matter:**

- **TB-1 — Tenant → Operator (request → enforcement).** A tenant authors a
  `PlaybookPlan` + `ClusterInventory` requesting nodes. The operator decides whether to
  build node-root infra for those nodes. This is the primary isolation boundary and the
  reason `NodeAccessPolicy` exists.
- **TB-2 — Plan namespace → Operator namespace (network).** The Job pod (tenant ns) must
  reach proxy pods (operator ns). Enforced by a per-run `NetworkPolicy` — *depends on a
  NetworkPolicy-enforcing CNI.*
- **TB-3 — Proxy pod → Node (privilege).** `nsenter` into host namespaces. This boundary
  is *intentionally collapsed* — that is the feature. The controls are all upstream of
  the SSH session (who gets a cert, which node the pod lands on).
- **TB-4 — Admin → Operator (policy authorship).** `NodeAccessPolicy` is cluster-scoped,
  writable only by principals with cluster RBAC (i.e. the admin; the CA is not a Secret — the
  operator mints it in memory). The value of the whole scheme is that policy and request come
  from **independent principals** (see §5, T-ESC-1).

**Design principle (load-bearing):** a check only has teeth when its two sides come from
independent principals. The *request* (ClusterInventory) is tenant-authored; the
*ceiling* (NodeAccessPolicy) is admin-authored; enforcement is a set **intersection** at
resolve time, so it can only ever *shrink* the request. This is why SSH-cert "source
namespace" pinning was rejected — the operator controls both the CA and the proxy sshd,
so any such check is tautological (same trust domain checking itself).

---

## 4. Data flow / attack surface

Numbered entry points where an actor injects data or makes a request:

1. **PlaybookPlan spec** — playbook text (→ runs as root), inventory refs, variables,
   files (`FilesSource::Other` = arbitrary Volume JSON), image, schedule, tolerations,
   TTL. Tenant-controlled.
2. **ClusterInventory spec** — node label selectors → requested nodes. Tenant-controlled.
3. **StaticInventory spec** — literal hostnames/IPs + SSH `SecretRef`. Tenant-controlled.
4. **Referenced Secrets** — variable/file/SSH-key Secrets in the plan namespace.
5. **NodeAccessPolicy spec** — namespaceSelector + nodeSelector. Admin-controlled.
6. **Node & Namespace labels** — consumed by selectors on both sides. Controlled by
   whoever can label nodes/namespaces (normally cluster admin; see T-ESC-3) — **and, for keys under
   `<namespace>.plan.ansible.cloudbending.dev/`, by the operator itself**, which publishes a plan's
   `spec.provides` version onto the Nodes that plan converged (T-ESC-9). Those keys are therefore
   the one part of this entry that is not admin-controlled; the value on a Node follows from what a
   tenant's playbook did, bounded by that namespace's own NodeAccessPolicy ceiling.
7. **Helm values** — proxy image, operator namespace, RBAC. Admin-controlled.
8. **The proxy pod SSH endpoint** — TCP/22, authenticated by client cert. Reachable by
   whatever the NetworkPolicy + CNI allow.
9. **The playbook's own runtime** — executing as root on the node; can reach the control
   plane, kubelet, other workloads on that node.

## 5. Threat enumeration (STRIDE)

Each threat: mechanism → current mitigation (grounded in code) → residual risk → severity.
Severity is qualitative for a shared multi-tenant cluster where tenants are semi-trusted.

### Spoofing

**T-SPOOF-1 — Forged SSH client identity to a proxy pod.**
An attacker presents a self-signed key to a proxy pod's sshd.
- *Mitigation:* sshd uses `TrustedUserCAKeys` — only certs signed by the operator CA are
  accepted (`render_sshd_config`; `PasswordAuthentication no`, `KbdInteractiveAuthentication no`).
  Certs are validated cryptographically (`ca.rs` tests confirm a foreign CA fails).
- *Residual:* reduces to "can you obtain a CA-signed client cert" (→ T-ID-1, A2/A3).
- *Severity:* Low in isolation; the real risk is credential reuse, below.

**T-SPOOF-2 — Rogue endpoint impersonating a proxy pod (host-cert spoofing).**
The client trusts host certs via `@cert-authority * <ca_pub>` — a **wildcard** principal
(`ensure_client_cert`). Any CA-signed host cert for any hostname is accepted; targeting
is by pod IP written into the rendered inventory.
- *Mitigation:* pod IPs are assigned by Kubernetes; the CA only signs host certs the
  operator itself generates.
- *Residual:* the wildcard means host identity is **not** cryptographically pinned to a
  specific node — a party able to answer on a proxy pod IP with any CA-signed host cert
  would be trusted. In-cluster IP spoofing is CNI-dependent but generally hard.
- *Severity:* Low–Medium; depends on CNI L2/L3 isolation.

### Tampering

**T-TAMP-1 — Tenant edits inventory after resolution to reach extra nodes.**
- *Mitigation:* `NodeAccessPolicy` is enforced at **every** reconcile (`node_access::enforce`,
  step 0b), against a **live** Node list, before any proxy infra is created. Inventory
  drift is re-clamped each tick (`cleanup_proxy_infra` GCs by hash label regardless of
  drift).
- *Residual:* window between label change and next reconcile; see T-TAMP-3.
- *Severity:* Low.

**T-TAMP-2 — Tampering with the workspace/client-cert Secret to alter what runs.**
- *Mitigation:* Secrets are operator-owned (ownerReferences), rendered server-side; the
  client-cert and var/file volumes mount `0400`, sshd config `0500`. Kubernetes RBAC
  governs who can edit them.
- *Residual:* anyone with `secrets` write in the plan namespace can alter the playbook
  workspace (it lives there) → arbitrary root on the plan's *already-authorized* nodes.
  This is within the tenant's existing authority, not an escalation.
- *Severity:* Low (by design the tenant already commands those nodes).

**T-TAMP-3 — Node relabeled into an allowed pool between reconciles.**
The Node set is fetched **live** in `enforce` (deliberately not cached) specifically so a
node stale-labelled *out* of its pool is not served. But label→effect latency still exists
for the next scheduled reconcile.
- *Residual:* node relabels are rare admin actions; latency is bounded by requeue/watch.
  Accepted trade-off (documented in `node_access.rs`).
- *Severity:* Low.

**T-TAMP-4 — Inventory group variables override connection/isolation host vars.**
`ClusterInventory`/`StaticInventory` groups may carry author-supplied `variables`, rendered as
Ansible group vars. An author could try to set `ansible_ssh_common_args` (weakening host-key
checking), `ansible_host`/`ansible_port` (redirecting the dial), or `ansible_user` to subvert the
managed-SSH/SSH wiring.
- *Mitigation:* the operator rejects the connection variables it renders itself
  (`ansible::RESERVED_HOST_VARS` — `ansible_host`, `ansible_port`, `ansible_timeout`, `ansible_user`,
  `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`, `ansible_ssh_common_args`) at inventory-resolve time
  (`reject_reserved_variables`, before any proxy infra), failing the reconcile with
  `ReservedInventoryVariable`. Independently, those vars are rendered per-**host**, which outranks
  group vars in Ansible precedence, so an accepted group var can never shadow them. A test
  (`reserved_vars_cover_every_rendered_host_var`) keeps the reserved list in step with what the
  renderer emits.
- *Residual:* the inventory author already runs arbitrary playbook code as root on their
  already-authorized nodes (T-TAMP-2, T-ESC-4); group vars grant no reach beyond that.
- *Severity:* Low.

### Repudiation

**T-REP-1 — No attribution of which principal caused a given node-root session.**
- *Mitigation:* client cert principal carries the run ID; proxy pods, Secrets,
  Jobs, and NetworkPolicies are labelled with `PLAYBOOKPLAN_HASH`, `RUN_ID`, and the applicable
  plan/host/component labels.
  `warn!` is emitted when NAP excludes nodes.
- *Residual:* no audit trail ties a proxy-pod session back to a *human*; sshd session
  logging inside the proxy is not persisted. The run-ID principal is enforced by sshd but identifies
  the run, not the human who authored it. K8s audit logs (if enabled) capture object
  creation but not in-session commands.
- *Severity:* Medium for forensics; consider shipping proxy sshd logs.

### Information disclosure

**T-INFO-1 — Operator's Secret access (scoped to enrolled namespaces).**
Secret access is granted per **enrolled** namespace via a `Role`/`RoleBinding`
(`role.yaml`/`rolebinding.yaml`), **not** cluster-wide — the `ClusterRole` does not mention
`secrets` (nor `jobs`/`pods`, and no write verb on `playbookplans`). The enrolled set = the
operator's own namespace ∪ the chart's `watchNamespaces`. `jobs: create,delete`,
`pods: get,list,watch` and `playbookplans: patch` are likewise scoped to the enrolled set.
- *Mitigation:* the operator can read/write Secrets and create Jobs only in
  namespaces an admin has explicitly enrolled — enrolment is an intentional "this namespace may drive
  node-root runs" decision, authored in `watchNamespaces` (static Helm/GitOps config, no runtime
  `rolebindings` write by the operator). A plan in a non-enrolled namespace is refused with
  `status.phase = UnauthorizedNamespace` before any Secret/Job call (fail-closed; no "all namespaces"
  escape hatch). Distroless image, no shell.
- *Residual:* within the enrolled namespaces the grant is still broad — operator compromise ⇒
  disclosure of Secrets in *those* namespaces, plus Job-`create`, Job-`delete`, Secret-`delete` and
  PlaybookPlan-`patch` write primitives *there* (the per-run client-cert Secret is created and reaped
  in the plan namespace, so `delete` is granted per enrolled namespace, not just the operator's;
  `jobs: delete` cancels a deleted plan's run and `playbookplans: patch` carries the run-cleanup
  finalizer, and RBAC can narrow neither to the objects or fields the operator actually touches).
  Widening `watchNamespaces` widens the blast radius accordingly; enrol conservatively.
- *Severity:* **Medium** — compromise discloses Secrets and yields Job-create/-delete, Secret-delete
  and plan-patch primitives only within the enrolled namespaces, not cluster-wide; the blast radius is
  bounded to the enrolled namespaces. Those write primitives are strictly smaller than the node-root
  execution the same compromise already grants on nodes those namespaces may target.

**T-INFO-1b — `Play` records expose a run's target inventory in the tenant namespace.**
Each `Play` records the `inventory` its run targeted — the plan's groups with the host names they
resolved to — so the recap can be reported per host after the Job is gone.
- *Mitigation:* it carries no Secret **material** and no plan configuration: `inventory` is group
  names and host names, nothing else. The records are namespaced to the plan and owner-referenced to
  it, so they are deleted with it.
- *Residual:* it discloses which nodes a namespace resolved to, including nodes a later
  `NodeAccessPolicy` change has since revoked. A principal granted `get plays` in an enrolled
  namespace can read that even without `get playbookplans`, so treat `plays` read access as
  equivalent to `playbookplans` read access for that namespace.
- *Severity:* **Low** — same namespace, no Secret material, no inline plan configuration, and
  enrolled namespaces are already expected to be dedicated to Ansible ops (R1).

**T-INFO-2 — CA private key disclosure.**
- *Mitigation:* the CA is generated in-memory at operator startup and **never persisted** —
  no Secret, nothing in etcd, never logged; only the private→public and signing operations
  are exposed in code (`ca.rs`). An operator restart rotates the CA.
- *Residual:* the attack surface is the running operator process itself — operator RCE or
  a process-memory read obtains A2 ⇒ mint a client cert bearing a live run's run-ID principal ⇒
  node-root on that run's reachable nodes. `get secret` in the operator namespace and
  etcd-at-rest do not disclose it. No in-process rotation/revocation: a leaked CA can keep
  minting certs for as long as the operator process runs (a restart rotates it).
- *Severity:* **High** — disclosure requires code execution or memory access in the operator
  process; read access to a Secret or to etcd-at-rest does not expose the key.

**T-INFO-3 — Cross-run credential reuse via a shared CA.**
Every proxy pod trusts the *same* CA, so a CA-signed client cert is not, on its own, bound
to a single run.
- *Mitigation (primary, cryptographic):* each proxy pod's sshd is configured with an
  `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile` listing **only its own run ID** (`build_secret`),
  and each run's client cert carries that ID as a principal (`ensure_client_cert`). sshd
  therefore rejects a cert whose run-ID principal doesn't match the proxy's run — a stray/leaked
  client cert from another run is refused at the cert layer, independent of network reach
  (verified end-to-end against the prod proxy sshd image by `managed_ssh::container_tests`).
- *Mitigation (defense in depth):* `build_network_policy` additionally restricts proxy-pod
  ingress to the Job pod in the plan namespace bearing the matching hash label.
- *Residual:* an attacker who can both reach another run's proxy pod IP **and** obtain that
  run's *own* client cert (A3) is still inside its own run's authorization — no cross-run
  escalation. A leaked client cert authenticates **only** to its own run's proxy pods, and those
  pods (plus the cert Secret) are deleted when the run completes (`cleanup_proxy_infra`); its 2h
  `CERT_VALIDITY` is thus only exploitable while those pods are alive, and deleting them is
  effectively immediate revocation. No other or future proxy accepts that principal.
- *Severity:* **Low** — cross-run reuse requires forging a run-ID principal (needs the CA
  key, i.e. T-INFO-2), not merely defeating NetworkPolicy. See §7 INV-4.

When an old-credential proxy pod is stuck terminating on a Node whose kubelet is unavailable, recovery
waits only for the configured heartbeat-aware grace period. It never adopts that proxy and deletes the
run's client-cert Secret during cleanup, but Kubernetes cannot guarantee the already-running
container has exited until the kubelet returns. This is a residual availability and stale-process risk
on the unreachable Node, not a path for a new run to authenticate to that proxy.

### Denial of service

**T-DOS-1 — Proxy-pod / Job flooding.**
A tenant creates many PlaybookPlans/hosts → many node-root pods (hostPID, host `/proc`) in
the operator namespace (one Job per run, but **one proxy pod per targeted host**).
- *Mitigation:* per-node Leases for mutual exclusion; Job `backoffLimit: 0`,
  `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` reaping; proxy infra GC'd per run by hash label.
- *Residual:* no per-tenant quota on plan/host count; proxy pods consume node resources on
  the *targeted* nodes; a large fan-out is a resource-exhaustion vector. ResourceQuota /
  LimitRange are not set by the chart.
- *Severity:* Medium.

**T-DOS-2 — Fail-closed lockout.**
NodeAccessPolicy enforcement is **always on**. With no matching policy, managed-ssh plans
resolve to **zero** nodes and silently do nothing.
- *Mitigation:* intentional (default-deny). `warn!` on exclusion; status shows
  `eligibleHosts`.
- *Residual:* an operator upgrading an existing cluster without deploying an allow-all
  policy will see all managed-ssh plans stop. This is a **breaking rollout caveat**, not a
  vuln — see §6.
- *Severity:* Operational, not security.

### Elevation of privilege (the core of this model)

**T-ESC-1 — Tenant targets nodes outside its remit ("business-team reaches admin nodes").**
The motivating threat: a namespace that can create a ClusterInventory could otherwise
target *any* node → node-root anywhere.
- *Mitigation:* `NodeAccessPolicy` intersection at resolve time. The ceiling is
  admin-authored (independent principal); enforcement can only shrink the request;
  fail-closed (`selector_matches_fail_closed`: empty selector matches **nothing**; no
  policy ⇒ zero nodes). Non-managed-ssh (StaticInventory) groups are untouched — they are
  not node-root.
- *Residual:* correctness of `selector_matches_fail_closed` and the enforce/clamp path is
  security-critical (unit-tested in `node_access.rs` + `nodeselector.rs`). See INV-1.
- *Severity:* **Critical if bypassed** — this is the primary tenant-isolation control.

**T-ESC-2 — Bypass NodeAccessPolicy via StaticInventory instead of ClusterInventory.**
StaticInventory targets arbitrary hostnames/IPs with a BYO SSH key and is explicitly
**out of scope** for NAP (it is not node-root; it carries its own credentials).
- *Residual:* a tenant can point a StaticInventory at a node's real sshd IP with a key
  they possess — but that is ordinary SSH the tenant could do anyway; it does **not** grant
  the node-root proxy primitive. Still, it is an unclamped egress/lateral-movement channel
  (playbook connects to arbitrary in-cluster or external IPs from the Job pod). The operator can
  optionally apply an egress NetworkPolicy to Job pods, but it is disabled by default and does not
  inherently restrict StaticInventory targets.
- *Severity:* Medium (egress/SSRF-style), by design outside NAP.

**T-ESC-3 — Node/Namespace label forgery to widen the ceiling.**
Both selectors match on labels. If a tenant can label a Namespace (e.g. their own) with a
label a permissive policy's namespaceSelector matches, or influence Node labels, they widen
their allow-set.
- *Mitigation:* Node labels are normally admin/kubelet-controlled; the `NodeRestriction`
  admission plugin limits a kubelet to its own node's labels; `kubernetes.io/metadata.name`
  is server-stamped and immutable.
- *Residual:* if tenants can set arbitrary labels on their own Namespace (common) **and**
  a policy's namespaceSelector keys off a forgeable label, they self-select into a scope.
  **Admins should target namespaces by the immutable `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` label**
  (the type docs recommend exactly this) and avoid nodeSelectors keyed on tenant-settable
  node labels.
- *Severity:* Medium–High depending on policy authorship discipline. See R4.

**T-ESC-4 — Playbook escapes to control-plane / other tenants from a rooted node.**
Once root on a node (by design), the playbook can read kubelet certs, other pods'
filesystems, secrets mounted on that node, and reach the API server as the node.
- *Mitigation:* none within this operator — this is the inherent power granted. Node
  affinity *softly* schedules the Job pod off targeted nodes (blast-radius hygiene, not a
  control).
- *Residual:* NAP bounds *which* nodes; it cannot bound what happens *on* an authorized
  node. Targeting a control-plane node ⇒ effective cluster admin.
- *Severity:* **Critical** — treat "authorized to run managed-ssh on node X" as "authorized
  to be root on node X and everything scheduled there." Scope policies accordingly
  (especially control-plane nodes).

**T-ESC-5 — Supply-chain: proxy image compromise.**
The proxy image is pulled into a **node-root** pod.
- *Mitigation:* the image is a **first-party** one (`ghcr.io/webd97/ansible-operator-sshd`) — a minimal
  `FROM scratch`, statically-linked OpenSSH `sshd` built from `Containerfile.sshd`, with only sshd, its
  libexec workers, busybox (`sh`/`nsenter`) and the privsep user/dir. Built `--without-openssl`
  (the operator is ed25519-only), so no OpenSSL/PAM in the node-root surface, from a
  **checksum-pinned** OpenSSH tarball (`OPENSSH_SHA256`). It is built + **cosign-signed** in CI on its
  own `sshd-v*` release tags (`release-sshd.yml`), and each release opens a PR that repins
  `managedSsh.proxyImage` (chart) and `proxy_image` (example config) onto that release's **`@sha256:`
  digest**. There is **no built-in default**: `proxy_image` is a required config value and the operator
  refuses to start without it (`config::require_proxy_image`), so a node-root image is always an
  explicit admin choice, never an implicit fallback.
- *Residual:* signature verification is not *enforced* at admission, so an operator relies on the
  digest pin (and their trust in this repo's release pipeline) rather than a cluster-side cosign policy.
  The pre-first-release chart seed is tag-based, not digest — only relevant before the first `sshd-v*`
  release repins it.
- *Severity:* **Low** once digest-pinned (the default after the first release); the residual is the
  absence of admission-enforced signature verification. See R5.

**T-ESC-6 — Execution-hash collision affecting security-relevant naming/labels.**
`ExecutionHash` (XxHash3_64, non-cryptographic) identifies desired content and contributes to the
run ID used by resource naming, cleanup, and certificate principals.
- *Residual:* a deliberate collision still affects drift detection. Run isolation mixes the plan
  UID, a process-local counter and a nanosecond clock reading into a separate run ID, so equal
  execution hashes do not share proxy resources or SSH principals. That run ID is minted once and
  never re-derived, so no run can *recompute* another's; two concurrently live runs colliding
  on one is a remote accident (a 64-bit hash truncated to 10 symbols) rather than something an
  author can steer, since the inputs that dominate it are not tenant-controlled.
- *Severity:* Low (hard to weaponize today), but note it is **not** a security boundary.

**T-ESC-7 — Playbook runs as an in-namespace ServiceAccount via `spec.serviceAccountName`.**
A `PlaybookPlan` may name any ServiceAccount in the plan namespace; the Job pod then runs as it and
mounts its token (`job_builder` sets `service_account_name` + `automount_service_account_token`). An
author who can only create `PlaybookPlan`s (not pods directly) thereby gains the ability to act with
any of that namespace's ServiceAccounts' API RBAC.
- *Mitigation:* **fail-closed by default** — when `serviceAccountName` is unset the operator sets
  `automountServiceAccountToken: false`, so a playbook that never asked for cluster access carries no
  API token at all (this also tightens the prior behaviour, where the namespace `default` SA token was
  always auto-mounted). Access is opt-in and scoped to the plan namespace. The enrollment fence (R1)
  already requires enrolled namespaces to be **dedicated to Ansible ops**, so every ServiceAccount in
  one is inside the Ansible trust boundary; and the author already runs arbitrary node-root playbook
  code, so this is not new capability against managed-ssh targets.
- *Residual:* a tenant able to author plans in an enrolled namespace can assume any ServiceAccount
  there — keep only ServiceAccounts you would trust a playbook to run as in enrolled namespaces, and
  do not co-locate privileged ServiceAccounts with playbook authoring rights.
- *Severity:* Medium — within-namespace, opt-in, and bounded by the enrollment fence; scales with how
  privileged the namespace's ServiceAccounts are.

**T-ESC-8 — Tampering with a `Play` record to steer a run in progress.**
A `Play` is no longer only history: recovery reads it back to decide whether an unlaunched run
may still be resumed, and to re-derive what that run executes. Anyone with `update` on `plays` in an
enrolled namespace could therefore try to rewrite what a committed run does.
- *Reduced attack surface:* the record stores neither the plan spec, nor the resolved inventory
  groups, nor the Job blueprint. All three are re-derived from **live** cluster state at resume time,
  so there is no stored copy of any of them to rewrite. What the record holds instead is a
  `preparationFingerprint` over exactly those inputs, and a run is resumed only while that
  fingerprint still matches what is re-derived. Editing the plan to change what a committed run
  executes does not redirect that run — it abandons the run and starts a new one under a new
  identity.
- *Mitigation (identity):* the CRD carries `self == oldSelf` on `spec`, freezing plan UID, execution
  hash, run ID, run number, target inventory, schedule slot and the preparation
  fingerprint. Because the inputs were reduced to that one hash, **every** field in the spec is
  typed — there is no `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields` corner that CEL cannot see into, so the
  rule covers the whole record rather than most of it. A unit test fails if a schemaless field is
  ever reintroduced under the spec.
- *Assumption:* this depends on CRD validation rules being evaluated, which the chart requires via
  its `kubeVersion` constraint. On a cluster that does not evaluate them the rule is silently absent
  rather than rejected, so verify it (see the `kubectl patch` check in the security guide) rather than
  assuming it.
- *Defense in depth:* independently of the rule, a resumed run derives its managed-SSH node set from
  the groups it is about to render and re-runs live `NodeAccessPolicy` revalidation over that set
  before any proxy pod exists — so no edit to a record can conjure a proxy pod on a node this
  namespace was never granted (INV-3/INV-3b/INV-5).
- *Residual:* a `plays` writer can still abort a run in its **own** namespace by making a record stop
  matching — the same namespace where it can already delete the run's Job outright, so this is an
  availability problem rather than an escalation one. A record's spec is written once at creation and
  never edited, so the chart grants the operator no `update` on `plays` either (see the RBAC table in
  §8 — it has `get,list,create,delete` on `plays`, and `update` only on `plays/status`). RBAC is
  additive and no chart can take a verb away, so administrators must ensure no untrusted principal
  receives it from another `Role`, `ClusterRole` or binding — and must verify that the CRD validation
  rule above is actually evaluated, since on a cluster that skips it a separately authorized writer
  can edit a spec the operator has no verb to repair.
- *Severity:* Low.

**T-ESC-9 — The operator's cluster-wide `nodes: patch`.**
So that a plan can publish what it provides, the operator holds `patch` on every Node in the
cluster (chart `nodeLabels.enabled`, default on). RBAC cannot narrow a verb to one field, so the
same grant can change taints, `spec.unschedulable`, `podCIDR`, `node-role.kubernetes.io/*` and any
other label — none of which the operator ever writes.
- *Scale of the change:* smaller than it looks. The operator is already root on every Node it can
  reach, through managed-SSH proxy pods (T-ESC-4), so this grants no new reach over the machines.
  What is new is a write on the **API** that needs no run behind it: a compromised operator process
  could cordon or relabel Nodes directly, without a playbook and without a proxy pod.
- *Mitigation:* a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` and binding (chart `nodeLabels.admissionPolicy`,
  default on) allow the operator's ServiceAccount to add, change and remove **only** label keys
  containing `.plan.ansible.cloudbending.dev/`, and require the Node's spec, annotations,
  ownerReferences, finalizers and every other label to be unchanged. It is scoped by
  `matchConditions` to that ServiceAccount, so it never constrains an administrator — including one
  cleaning these labels up by hand.
- *Assumption:* `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` is GA only from Kubernetes 1.30, while the chart
  supports 1.25 and up. A cluster older than that must set `nodeLabels.admissionPolicy=false` and
  runs with the permission unguarded, or set `nodeLabels.enabled=false` and give up the feature.
  The chart deliberately does not detect the API: `helm template` without `--api-versions` reports
  it as missing, so a capability check would drop the guard silently while keeping the permission.
  An explicit value fails the install loudly instead.
- *Not a tenant escalation:* a tenant cannot choose the key. It is derived from the plan's namespace
  and name, so no plan can write a label that widens its own NodeAccessPolicy ceiling, steer another
  namespace's workloads through a well-known key, or overwrite another plan's claim (T-ESC-3). What
  a NodeAccessPolicy keyed on one of these labels *does* delegate is covered in the node-access
  guide — the ceiling then follows the providing plan's tenant, up to that plan's own ceiling.
- *Residual:* anything with root on a Node can forge its own Node's label through the kubelet
  (`NodeRestriction` permits a kubelet to label its own Node outside the reserved prefixes), which
  every managed-SSH playbook already has. For ordering this costs nothing — that tenant is root on
  the machine either way. For a NodeAccessPolicy built on such a label it is the delegation above.
- *Severity:* Low with the policy, Medium without it.

## 6. Deployment assumptions & required controls

This design is **only** as strong as the environment it runs in. The following are
**requirements**, not recommendations:

1. **A NetworkPolicy-enforcing CNI is strongly recommended (defense in depth).** Cross-run
   isolation is enforced primarily at the sshd cert layer — each proxy accepts only its own
   run's run-ID principal via `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile` (T-INFO-3) — so a non-enforcing CNI does
   not collapse it. NetworkPolicy still limits reachability to node-root proxy pods and blocks
   non-cert traffic; keep it on for multi-tenant.
2. **Deploy a `NodeAccessPolicy` for the operator namespace before/at rollout.**
   Enforcement is always-on and fail-closed; absent a policy, managed-ssh plans resolve to
   zero nodes (T-DOS-2). See the `cluster-admins` doc in
   [`examples/v1beta1/node-access-policy.yaml`](examples/v1beta1/node-access-policy.yaml).
3. **Lock down the operator namespace.** It runs the node-root proxy pods and the Tier-0
   operator ServiceAccount, and holds their per-host Secrets and NetworkPolicies. Per-run client
   certificates live in enrolled plan namespaces (A3), while the CA itself is in-memory only (A2).
   Operator compromise still yields it. Restrict RBAC,
   enable etcd encryption at rest, and treat this namespace as Tier-0.
4. **Author policies against immutable/admin-controlled labels** (`kubernetes.io/metadata.name`
   for namespaces; admin-managed node pool labels), never tenant-settable ones (T-ESC-3).
5. **Restrict who can create ClusterInventory/PlaybookPlan** (e.g. admission policy). NAP
   bounds *which nodes*, but managed-ssh on any authorized node is root on that node (T-ESC-4).
6. **Pin the proxy image** to a digest from a registry you trust, via `managedSsh.proxyImage`.
   The chart seed is digest-pinned; preserve that property when overriding it (T-ESC-5).

---

## 7. Security invariants (must not regress)

- **INV-1 — Fail-closed selectors.** `selector_matches_fail_closed` MUST treat an empty
  selector as matching nothing. No matching policy MUST yield zero allowed nodes. (Tests in
  `nodeselector.rs`, `node_access.rs`.)
- **INV-2 — Enforcement is intersection-only.** `enforce` MUST only ever remove hosts from
  managed-ssh groups; it must never add or substitute nodes. StaticInventory/Ssh groups MUST
  pass through untouched.
- **INV-3 — Enforcement runs before proxy infra.** NodeAccessPolicy clamping MUST happen at
  inventory resolve time (step 0b), before any proxy pod/Secret/NetworkPolicy is created,
  and on **every** reconcile (re-clamps drift).
- **INV-3b — Every run re-authorizes before it creates proxy pods.** `ensure_infra_and_launch` MUST
  derive its managed-SSH node set from the groups it is about to render and re-run
  `node_access::enforce` over that set **before** `ensure_proxy_infra` — that set is what proxy pods
  are actually created from. Fresh and resumed runs share that one code path precisely so a
  resume cannot take a laxer route than the tick it interrupted, and deriving the set live is what
  keeps a stale or tampered record from standing in for it (T-ESC-8).
- **INV-4 — Cross-run isolation is enforced at the cert layer, with NetworkPolicy as backup.**
  Each proxy pod's `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile` MUST list **only its own run ID**
  (never `root` or a wildcard); adding `root` there re-opens cross-run cert reuse (T-INFO-3). The
  per-run NetworkPolicy MUST still accompany proxy pods (ingress restricted to the matching Job
  pod; podSelector/hash + `RUN_ID` label wiring on the Job pod template MUST match — job_builder
  sets the template metadata labels) as defense in depth.
- **INV-5 — Node set is authoritative & live.** The allow-set MUST be computed from a live
  Node read in `enforce`, never a possibly-stale cache. (Deliberate; see `node_access.rs`.)
- **INV-6 — CA private key never leaves the operator process** — generated in memory, never
  persisted to a Secret/etcd, and never written to logs, status, workspace Secrets, or the
  execution hash.
- **INV-7 — Proxy pods carry both `PLAYBOOKPLAN_HASH` and `PLAYBOOKPLAN_HOST`** so cleanup's
  label-scoped `delete_collection` cannot sweep the ansible Job pod (which lacks `_HOST`).
- **INV-8 — The operator writes only its own Node labels.** Every Node write the operator makes MUST
  be confined to label keys of the form `<namespace>.plan.ansible.cloudbending.dev/<plan>`, derived
  from the plan's own namespace and name and never from anything a tenant supplies. It MUST never
  write a Node's spec, annotations, or any label outside that form. The key being operator-derived
  is what stops a plan labelling its way past a NodeAccessPolicy ceiling (T-ESC-3/T-ESC-9); where
  the chart's `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` is enabled, the API server enforces the same bound.

Any change touching these paths should re-verify the corresponding unit tests and this list.

## 8. Operator privilege summary (blast radius)

From [`clusterrole.yaml`](chart/templates/clusterrole.yaml) (cluster-wide) and
[`role.yaml`](chart/templates/role.yaml) (rendered once per enrolled namespace):

| Resource | Verbs | Scope | Risk note |
|----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| secrets | get,list,watch,create,patch,delete | **enrolled ns only** | Reads/writes Secrets only in enrolled namespaces, not cluster-wide. `delete` reaps the per-run managed-ssh client-cert Secret, created in the plan namespace so the Job pod can mount it. |
| secrets | delete,deletecollection | operator ns | Run cleanup (per-host proxy Secrets). |
| jobs | get,list,watch,create,delete | **enrolled ns only** | One Job per run in the plan ns, not cluster-wide. `delete` cancels the run of a deleted plan or a run whose `Play` record disappeared, rather than leaving the pod to the deleting client's propagation policy; finished Jobs are reaped by their TTL. The operator deletes only a Job it has validated as its own run's (UID precondition included), but RBAC cannot scope `delete` to Jobs it created, so the grant covers every Job in an enrolled namespace. |
| pods | get,list,watch | **enrolled ns only** | Read termination message, not cluster-wide. |
| playbookplans | patch | **enrolled ns only** | Adds and removes the `ansible.cloudbending.dev/run-cleanup` finalizer, which holds a plan deleted mid-run open until its node-root proxy pods and host Leases are released (nothing else can reach them — they live in the operator ns, where an OwnerReference cannot follow). The finalizer is the only field the operator writes here, but RBAC cannot restrict `patch` to `metadata.finalizers`: the grant permits writing the spec and metadata of any plan in an enrolled namespace. Kept out of the `ClusterRole`, which stays read-only for plans, so plan writes are confined to namespaces already trusted to run node-root playbooks. |
| plays | get,list,create,delete | **enrolled ns only** | Operator-authored recovery/history records. The spec carries plan UID, execution hash, run ID, preparation fingerprint, target inventory, run number, and schedule slot; Jobs and pod templates are correlated to the Play UID. It stores no copy of the plan spec, resolved connection configuration or the Job — those are re-derived from live cluster state. Every field is typed, so the CRD's CEL rule freezes the whole spec (T-ESC-8). Contains no Secret material. |
| plays/status | update | **enrolled ns only** | Advances the operator-owned Prepared → Starting → Launching → Running → terminal state machine and acknowledges that terminal results reached PlaybookPlan status. Resource-version-checked replacements prevent stale writers from reverting terminal state or racing authorization cleanup against committed Job creation. |
| pods | create,delete,deletecollection | operator ns | **Creates node-root proxy pods.** |
| networkpolicies | delete,create,patch | **enrolled ns** (`delete` everywhere; `create,patch` in plan namespaces when `networkPolicy.enabled`, and always in operator ns) | Run isolation. |
| networkpolicies | deletecollection | **operator ns only** | Run isolation cleanup for proxy policies. |
| leases | get,create,update,delete | operator ns | Per-node mutual exclusion. |
| nodes | get,list,watch | cluster-wide | Selector resolution / NAP allow-set (cluster-scoped resource). |
| nodes | patch | cluster-wide | Only with `nodeLabels.enabled` (default on). Publishes a plan's `spec.provides` version as `<namespace>.plan.ansible.cloudbending.dev/<plan>` on the Nodes that plan converged, so other plans can depend on it. The operator writes nothing else on a Node (INV-8), but RBAC cannot scope `patch` to one label key: the grant permits taints, `spec.unschedulable` and any label on any Node. `nodeLabels.admissionPolicy` (default on) renders a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` that holds the operator's own ServiceAccount to exactly those keys; below Kubernetes 1.30 that API does not exist and the grant is unguarded (T-ESC-9). |
| namespaces | get,list,watch | cluster-wide | namespaceSelector matching (cluster-scoped resource). |
| playbookplans/clusterinventories/staticinventories/nodeaccesspolicies | get,list,watch | cluster-wide | CRDs — read cluster-wide so plans in non-enrolled namespaces are seen and reported. |
| playbookplans/clusterinventories/nodeaccesspolicies (/status) | patch | cluster-wide | Status writes (incl. `UnauthorizedNamespace`); StaticInventory has no status-writing controller. |

The *enrolled set* = the operator's own namespace (always) ∪ the chart's `watchNamespaces`. The
`secrets`/`jobs`/`pods` grants, and the `playbookplans: patch` grant behind the run-cleanup
finalizer, live in a per-enrolled-namespace `Role`/`RoleBinding`, not the `ClusterRole` (see
[`role.yaml`](chart/templates/role.yaml)); the `ClusterRole`'s access to plans is read-only.

**Net:** the operator is **Tier-0** for node-root capability *on enrolled namespaces*. Operator
compromise does not imply whole-cluster Secret disclosure or a cluster-wide
Job-create/-delete, Secret-delete or plan-patch primitive — the blast radius is bounded to the
enrolled namespaces. Node-root reach into only a few enrolled
tenant namespaces is materially smaller than "≈ cluster compromise."

## 9. Residual risks & open recommendations

The mitigations described in §5 and §8 are implemented and in place; the items below are the
residual risks that remain open. (R1 — scoping Secret/Job/Pod access to enrolled namespaces — is
fully implemented and carries no open tail; see T-INFO-1 and §8.)

| ID | Recommendation | Addresses | Priority |
|----|----------------|-----------|----------|
| R2 | The CA is rotated only by an operator restart. Consider periodic restarts (or an in-process rotation timer) to bound the window in which a leaked/compromised CA (T-INFO-2) can mint certs. A leaked *client* cert is already bounded by proxy-pod lifetime — principal-scoped, and the pods plus the cert Secret are deleted on completion (`cleanup_proxy_infra`) — so a shorter `CERT_VALIDITY` or a CRL adds little. | T-INFO-2 | Low |
| R3 | Bind the client-cert principal to specific *host(s)*, not just the run, for intra-run host scoping; document the CNI / defense-in-depth posture in the chart `NOTES.txt`. | T-INFO-3 | Low |
| R4 | Ship a linter/validating admission example that rejects NodeAccessPolicies keyed on tenant-settable labels; recommend `kubernetes.io/metadata.name` in docs (already in type docs). | T-ESC-3 | Medium |
| R5 | The default proxy image is a first-party, minimal, statically-linked sshd (`ansible-operator-sshd`, from a checksum-pinned source in `Containerfile.sshd`), built + cosign-signed in CI on `sshd-v*` tags, with each release repinning the chart default onto its `@sha256:` digest. Still open: document/ship a cluster-side admission policy (e.g. cosign/policy-controller) that *enforces* the signature at pod-create, so the digest pin is backed by verification rather than trust alone. | T-ESC-5 | Low |
| R6 | Persist/ship proxy sshd session logs and emit a structured audit event per node-root session for attribution. | T-REP-1 | Medium |
| R7 | Add per-tenant ResourceQuota/LimitRange guidance and optionally a max-fan-out guard. | T-DOS-1 | Low |
| R8 | Pin host identity: replace the `@cert-authority *` wildcard with per-host known_hosts entries so host certs are bound to the intended node. | T-SPOOF-2 | Low |
| R9 | Consider a cryptographic hash (or explicit run UID) wherever `ExecutionHash` feeds security-relevant naming/labels/principals. | T-ESC-6 | Low |

---

## 10. Out of scope / accepted

- **Root on an authorized node** (T-ESC-4): inherent to the product. NAP bounds *which*
  nodes; on an authorized node the playbook is fully trusted. Scope policies (esp.
  control-plane) as if granting root.
- **A malicious cluster admin**: the admin authors policy and the chart, and controls the
  operator that mints the CA — they are the root of trust, not an adversary in this model.
- **StaticInventory targeting external hosts** with tenant-owned keys: ordinary SSH the
  tenant could perform regardless; outside NAP by design (T-ESC-2), noted as an egress channel.

---

### Appendix A — Certificate model at a glance

- One ephemeral **Ed25519 CA** per operator process — generated in memory at startup
  (`CertificateAuthority::generate` in `main.rs`), never persisted; a restart rotates it.
- Per **proxy pod**: a fresh host keypair, host cert signed for principal `<hostname>`,
  valid 2h. Presented to clients; clients trust via `@cert-authority *`.
- Per **run**: one client keypair, client cert signed for principals `["root", "<run-id>"]`,
  valid 2h, trusted by every proxy pod via `TrustedUserCAKeys`. `<run-id>` is the *enforced*
  principal (see below); `root` is retained for `PermitRootLogin yes` / the default username check.
- Scoping of a client to "its own" proxies is **cert-level**: each proxy pod's sshd sets
  `AuthorizedPrincipalsFile` to a file containing only that run's `<run-id>`, so it accepts only
  this run's client cert. The per-run NetworkPolicy is defense in depth on top — see T-INFO-3 / R3.
- Because the principal is run-scoped and the proxy pods (and the client-cert Secret) are deleted
  on run completion (`cleanup_proxy_infra`), a client cert is inert once its run ends — nothing on
  the cluster will accept it, regardless of the 2h validity remaining.
